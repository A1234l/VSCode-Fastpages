Understand how computers can be used to represent real-world phenomena or outcomes | Compare simulations with real-world contexts. | Implement code to mimic real world situations, problems, or phenomena. | What are simulations by College Board definition? . Simulations are models that mimic more complex objects or phenomena from the real world Purposes include drawing inferences without the costs or ricks of the real world | . | Simulations use varying sets of values to reflect the current state of a real phenomenon | Often, when developing a simulation, it is necessary to remove specific variables or simplify aspects Simulations can often contain biases based on which details or real-world elements were included/excluded | . | Simulations allow the formulation of properties under consideration | Variability and randomness of the world is considered using random number generators | Examples: rolling dice, spinners, molecular models, analyze chemicals/reactions... | . . Analyzing an Example: Air-Traffic Simulator . Say we want to find out what the optimal number of aircrafts that can be in the air in one area is. | A simulation allows us to explore this question without real world contraints of money, time, safety Unfortunately we can&#39;t just fly 67 planes all at once and see what happens | . | Since the simulation won&#39;t be able to take all variables into control, it may have a bias towards one answer | Will not always have the same result | . Functions we often need (python) . import random # a module that defines a series of functions for generating or manipulating random integers random.choice() #returns a randomly selected element from the specified sequence random.choice(mylist) # returns random value from list random.randint(0,10) #randomly selects an integer from given range; range in this case is from 0 to 10 random.random() #will generate a random float between 0.0 to 1. . Functions we often need (js) . // Math.random(); returns a random number // Math.floor(Math.random() * 10); // Returns a random integer from 0 to 9: . College Board Question 1 . Question: The following code simulates the feeding of 4 fish in an aquarium while the owner is on a 5-day trip: . numFish ← 4 foodPerDay ← 20 foodLeft ← 160 daysStarving ← 0 REPEAT 5 TIMES { foodConsumed ← numFish * foodPerDay foodLeft ← foodLeft - foodConsumed IF (foodLeft &lt; 0) { daysStarving ← daysStarving + 1 } . } . This simulation simplifies a real-world scenario into something that can be modeled in code and executed on a computer. | Summarize how the code works: | . Examples . Card Flip . import random cards = [&quot;Ace&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;10&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Queen&quot;, &quot;King&quot;] suits = [&quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;, &quot;Spades&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;] print(random.choice(cards) + &quot; of &quot; + random.choice(suits)) . Coin Flip . import random def coinflip(): #def function randomflip = random.randint(0, 2) #picks either 0 or 1 randomly if randomflip == 0 or randomflip == 1: #assigning 0 to be heads--&gt; if 0 is chosen then it will print, &quot;Heads&quot; print(&quot;Heads&quot;) else: if randomflip == 2: #assigning 1 to be tails--&gt; if 1 is chosen then it will print, &quot;Tails&quot; print(&quot;Tails&quot;) #Tossing the coin 5 times: t1 = coinflip() t2 = coinflip() t3 = coinflip() t4 = coinflip() t5 = coinflip() . Heads Heads Heads Heads Heads . Your turn: Change the code to make it simulate the flipping of a weighted coin. . Adding images (in Python) . Add a heads and tails images into your images directory with the correct names and run the code below | . import random # importing Image class from PIL package from PIL import Image # creating a object im = Image.open(r&quot;images/coin_heads.png&quot;) image = Image.open(r&quot;images/coin_tails.png&quot;) i=random.randint(0,1) if i == 1: print(&quot;heads&quot;) display(im) else: print(&quot;tails&quot;) display(image) . heads . In order to display an image in python, we can use the PIL package we previously learned about. . Spin the Wheel . import random print(&quot;Spin the wheel!&quot;) print(&quot;-&quot;) n = 10 blue = 0 red = 0 blueImg = Image.open(r&quot;images/blue_color.png&quot;) redImg = Image.open(r&quot;images/red_color.png&quot;) for i in range(n): spin = random.randint(1,2) if spin == 1: # head blue = blue + 1 display(blueImg) else: # tail red = red + 1 display(redImg) print(&#39;Number of blue:&#39;, blue) print(&#39;Number of red:&#39;, red) . Spin the wheel! - . Number of blue: 4 Number of red: 6 . Your turn: Add a visual to the simulation! . Population Growth and Plots . import random totalPopulation = 50 growthFactor = 1.00005 dayCount = 0 #Every 2 months the population is reported while totalPopulation &lt; 1000000: totalPopulation *= growthFactor #Every 56th day, population is reported dayCount += 1 if dayCount == 56: dayCount = 0 print(totalPopulation) . Here we initialize the total population to be 50, then set the growth factor as 1.00005 (.005 percent change). It will print the population every 56th day until it reaches one million. It multiplies the current population by the growth factor in each iteration, and increments the day count. When the day count reaches 56, it prints the current population and resets the day count to 0. . Note! This simulation assumes that the growth factor remains constant as time progresses, which may not be a realistic assumption in real-world scenarios. . import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Define the initial population and growth rate population = 100 growth_rate = 0.05 # Define the number of years to simulate num_years = 50 # Create lists to store the population and year values populations = [population] years = [0] # Simulate population growth for the specified number of years for year in range(1, num_years+1): # Calculate the new population size new_population = population + (growth_rate * population) # Update the population and year lists populations.append(new_population) years.append(year) # Set the new population as the current population for the next iteration population = new_population # Plot the population growth over time plt.plot(years, populations) plt.xlabel(&#39;Year&#39;) plt.ylabel(&#39;Population&#39;) plt.title(&#39;Population Growth Simulation&#39;) plt.show() . If we create quantative data, we can plot it using the Matplotlib library. . Example on how simplification can cause bias . import random beak = [&quot;small-beak&quot;, &quot;long-beak&quot;, &quot;medium-beak&quot;], wing = [&quot;small-wings&quot;, &quot;large-wings&quot;, &quot;medium-wings&quot;], height = [&quot;short&quot;, &quot;tall&quot;,&quot;medium&quot;] naturaldisaster = [&quot;flood&quot;, &quot;drought&quot;, &quot;fire&quot;, &quot;hurricane&quot;, &quot;dustbowl&quot;] print(&quot;When a&quot; , random.choice(naturaldisaster) , &quot;hit&quot;, random.choice(height), &quot;birds died&quot;) . When a drought hit medium birds died . How does this simulation have bias? . It doesn&#39;t consider the exact cause for the death of birds. Only the height of the bird is shown which gives inadequate information. The death of birds and their physical traits only show an association, not causation. . JS examples .

Learning Objectives . DAT-1.A: Representing Data with Bits . Basic Information . Bit is short for binary digit, and represents a value of either 0 or 1. A byte is 8 bits. | . | Sequences of bits are used to represent different things. Representing data with sequences of bits is called abstraction. | . | . Practice Questions: . How many bits are in 3 bytes? | There are 24 bits in 3 bytes. | . What digital information can be represented by bits? | It can represent strings, numbers, images, etc. It depends on how you store the bits. | . Are bits an analog or digital form of storing data? What is the difference between the two? | Bits are a digital form of storing data. Analog is constant, while bits are either 1s or 0s. | . Examples . Boolean variables (true or false) are the easiest way to visualize binary. 0 = False | 1 = True | . | . import random def example(runs): # Repeat code for the amount of runs given while runs &gt; 0: # Assigns variable boolean to either True or False based on random binary number 0 or 1. boolean = False if random.randint(0, 1) == 0 else True # If the number was 1 (True), it prints &quot;awesome.&quot; if boolean: print(&quot;binary is awesome&quot;) # If the number was 2 (False), it prints &quot;cool.&quot; else: print(&quot;binary is cool&quot;) runs -= 1 # Change the parameter to how many times to run the function. example(10) . binary is cool binary is awesome binary is cool binary is awesome binary is cool binary is cool binary is cool binary is cool binary is awesome binary is awesome . DAT-1.B: The Consequences of Using Bits to Represent Data . Basic Information . Integers are represented by a fixed number of bits, this limits the range of integer values. This limitation can result in overflow or other errors. | Other programming languages allow for abstraction only limited by the computers memory. | Fixed number of bits are used to represent real numbers/limits | . Practice Questions: . What is the largest number can be represented by 5 bits? | 31. | . One programing language can only use 16 bits to represent non-negative numbers, while a second language uses 56 bits to represent numbers. How many times as many unique numbers can be represented by the second language? | 2^40 times. | . 5 bits are used to represent both positive and negative numbers, what is the largest number that can be represented by these bits? (hint: different thatn question 1) | 15 | . Examples . import math def exponent(base, power): # Print the operation performed, turning the parameters into strings to properly concatenate with the symbols &quot;^&quot; and &quot;=&quot;. print(str(base) + &quot;^&quot; + str(power) + &quot; = &quot; + str(math.pow(base, power))) # How can function become a problem? (Hint: what happens if you set both base and power equal to high numbers?) exponent(5, 2) . 5^2 = 25.0 . DAT-1.C: Binary Math . Basic Information . Binary is Base 2, meaning each digit can only represent values of 0 and 1. | Decimal is Base 10, meaning eacht digit can represent values from 0 to 9. | Conversion between sequences of binary to decimal depend on how many binary numbers there are, their values and their positions. | . Practice Questions: . What values can each digit of a Base 5 system represent? | 0 to 4. | . What base is Hexadecimal? What range of values can each digit of Hexadecimal represent? | Hexadecimal is 16. The range of values in hexadecimal is from 0 to 15. | . When using a base above 10, letters can be used to represent numbers past 9. These letters start from A and continue onwards. For example, the decimal number 10 is represented by the letter A in Hexadecimal. What letter would be used to represent the Base 10 number 23 in a Base 30 system? What about in a Base 50 system? | N in base 30 system. Also N in base 50 system. | . Examples . Using 6 bits, we can represent 64 numbers, from 0 to 63, as 2^6 = 64. | The numbers in a sequence of binary go from right to left, increasing by powers of two from 0 to the total amount of bits. The whole number represented is the sum of these bits. For example: 111111 | 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 | 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 | 63 | | Fill in the blanks (convert to decimal) . 001010 = 10 | 11100010 = 226 | 10 = 2 | | Fill in the blanks (convert to binary) . 12 = 1100 | 35 = 100011 | 256 = 100000000 | | .

The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web. . The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection. . The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then encapsulating the data into IP packets. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network. . The “network” layer is responsible for routing data packets between networks using the Internet Protocol (IP).

The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web. . The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection. . The “ip” layer is responsible for packeting data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then encapsulating the data into IP packets. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network. . The “network” layer is responsible for routing data packets between networks using the Internet Protocol (IP). This layer handles tasks such as packet addressing and routing, fragmentation and reassembly, and network congestion control. . Fault Tolerance . Watch both Daily videos for 4.2 . Complete the network activity, summarize your understanding of fault tolerance. i. Yes the network is fault tolerant, as if any link or any points is broken the information can still be distributed to other points in the system. | ii. No the network is not fault tolerant, as if node C goes down, then information can’t be sent to F and thus it is not fault tolerant. | iii. No the network is not fault tolerant, as if node G comes down, then information can’t be sent to A and thus the system cannot be described as fault tolerant. Option C | Option A | The importance of fault tolerance is that there is redundancy in your system and one faulty link doesn’t compromise the entire system and information can still be transmitted throughout the entire system. The internet is an example of such a system as if one link is broken, the information can still be sent through other links while the broken link is being repaired. Thus it is vital to create fault tolerant systems with at least one backup link or node per connection in case of a failure. | | . | . Parallel and Distributed Computing . Review previous lecture on Parallel Computing and watch Daily video 4.3. Think of ways to make something in you team project to utilize Cores more effectively. Here are some thoughts to add to your story of Computers and Networks… . What is naturally Distributed in Frontend/Backend architecture? In a frontend/backend architecture, the frontend and backend are naturally distributed components. The frontend typically consists of the user interface and presentation layer, while the backend contains the business logic and data storage. The frontend is distributed across multiple devices or clients, such as web browsers, mobile devices, or desktop applications. Each client has its own instance of the frontend code, which communicates with the backend over a network connection. The backend is typically deployed on one or more servers or cloud platforms. The servers may be physically distributed across multiple locations, and the backend may be composed of multiple services or microservices that work together to provide the required functionality. The distributed nature of the frontend/backend architecture allows for scalability, fault tolerance, and performance optimization. The frontend can be scaled by adding more clients or instances, while the backend can be scaled by adding more servers or services. Fault tolerance can be achieved by replicating the backend across multiple servers or locations, and load balancing can be used to optimize performance by distributing the load across multiple servers. Overall, the frontend/backend architecture is a popular and effective way of building modern web applications that can handle large volumes of users and data. | . | Analyze this command in Docker: ENV GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS=&quot;--workers=1 --bind=0.0.0.0:8086&quot;. Determine if there is options are options in this command for parallel computing within the server that runs python/gunicorn. Here is an article The GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS environment variable is used to set command-line arguments for the Gunicorn web server when it starts up. In the provided command, --workers=1 and --bind=0.0.0.0:8086 are specified as arguments. To run the Gunicorn server in parallel, you can increase the number of worker processes to handle multiple requests simultaneously. To do this, simply set the --workers argument to a higher number. For example, if you want to run four worker processes, you can set the argument to --workers=4. It&#39;s important to note that the number of workers you can run at once will depend on the resources available on your system and the workload your application is handling. Be careful not to increase the number of workers beyond what your system can handle, as this can cause performance issues or even crashes. To make sure everything is running smoothly, it&#39;s a good idea to monitor the resource usage of the worker processes while the server is running with multiple workers. You can use tools like htop, top, or systemd to keep an eye on things. In summary, to run the Gunicorn server in parallel, set the --workers argument to a number that your system can handle, and keep an eye on the resource usage of the worker processes to ensure everything stays stable. | . | .

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # I noticed that only the 1,2,3 are in the output, and the 2,1 are not included in the output. # # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables as they both involve unique values. # . {1, 2, 3} .

            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. . Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? . big O notation manages complexity | . Take a look at our lassen volcano example from the data compression tech talk.

Do you think this is a time complexity or space complexity or both problem? . It is a both problem because it takes time and space. | . Big O Notation . Constant O(1) | Linear O(n) | Quadratic O(n^2) | Logarithmic O(logn) | Exponential (O(2^n)) | . numbers = list(range(1000)) print(numbers) . Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . 263 Alabama . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . 178 1.78 . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) . Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . [[18, 28], [18, 28]] . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . 263 . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) print(fibonacci(30)) # print(fibonacci(40)) . 832040 . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1,2,3])) print(generate_subsets([1,2,3,4,5])) #print(generate_subsets(numbers)) . Using the time library, we are able to see the difference in time it takes to calculate the fibonacci function above. . Based on what is known about the other time complexities, hypothesize the resulting elapsed time if the function is replaced. | . import time start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(34)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(35)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) . 5702887 Time taken: 1.7146875858306885 seconds 9227465 Time taken: 3.6633431911468506 seconds . Hacks . Record your findings when testing the time elapsed of the different algorithms. Findings: | constant O(1) and logarithmic O(logn) seem to run in the shortest amount of time. | Linear O(n) is the next shortest amount of time. | Exponential O(n^2) starts of with a short amount of time, but the time increases exponentially for each time you increase the number in the parameter by 1. | Quadratic O(n^2) seems to take the most amount of time. | All depends on the quantity. The O with an exponent in the time are faster when the list is shorter. | . | Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. Selection sort: Finds the lowest values and swaps it with the number in the first position. In the second position, the number moves to the third position. If the swap between second and third position puts the next lowest number in the second position, the now third position moves on. This sequence continues until the list is completely sorted. | Bubble sort: Two sets of numbers are sorted each time. They are sorted to make the lower number go behind the higher one. It continues to sort it in pairs until it reaches the last number. The algorithm then sorts it in pairs starting at the first position again, and keeps doing this. Once it is complete, the algorithm has to run again with no swapped numbers to verify that the entire list is sorted. | Insertion sort: Similar to bubble sort, but if it does swap two values, it tracks the lower value by going back a position and keeps sorting that lower value until it is in the right place. | . | Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? Time and space complexity is important when choosing an algorithm because you need time-efficiency, so that consumers and your coworkers can be more productive when using the algorithm. You also do not have unlimited space, so reducing the space as much as possible can save more storage for other purposes and can save more money. | . | Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? No. Constant time algorithms are useful for sorting large amounts of data. Exponential time algorithms are useful for sorting smaller amounts of data, and if it is small enough it can actually be more efficient than constant time algorithms. | . | What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? All of them involve lists. They also all involve some sort of mathematical calculations. Binary search seems to include logarithm algorithm, and exponential can also involve number theory.

Explore SQLite Connect object to establish database connection- Explore SQLite Cursor Object to fetch data from a table within a database | . Schema of Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses PRAGMA statement to read schema. . Describe Schema, here is resource Resource- What is a database schema? . A database schema dictates how data is organized, such as with tables, fields, JSON, etc. | What is the purpose of identity Column in SQL database? | The identity column helps identify different profiles in the database. It is unique to every profile, so it makes it able to distinguish users in the data. | What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database? | The purpose of the primary key is to make the data unique. This allows each profile in the data to be distinguishable from each other. | What are the Data Types in SQL table? | Exact numbers, approximate numbers, date and time, character strings, unicode character strings, binary strings, etc. | . import sqlite3 database = &#39;instance/sqlite.db&#39; # this is location of database def schema(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Fetch results of Schema results = cursor.execute(&quot;PRAGMA table_info(&#39;students&#39;)&quot;).fetchall() # Print the results for row in results: print(row) # Close the database connection conn.close() # schema() .

Reading Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL SELECT statement to read data . What is a connection object? After you google it, what do you think it does? | A connection object represents each SQLite database. I think it is responsible for connecting to the database so it can create cursor objects and transaction control. | Same for cursor object? | Yes, cursor object allows the use of commands, and also fetches the data. | Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger. What attributes are in the object? | conn.cursor() has attributes of special variables, function variables, class variables, in_transaction, isolation_level, row_factory, and total_changes. For the objects, all of the attributes say &quot;none.&quot; | Is &quot;results&quot; an object? How do you know? | &quot;Results can be an object because it prints out the entire database. I know this because in the debugger is has the [()] thing with all the rows and data in it. | . import sqlite3 def read(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Execute a SELECT statement to retrieve data from a table results = cursor.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM students&#39;).fetchall() # Print the results if len(results) == 0: print(&quot;Table is empty&quot;) else: for row in results: print(row) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() # read() .

Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL INSERT to add row . Compore create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations? | Imperative:Has less code and is easier to work with than OOP. However, it is unable to check for garbage data such as in gradDate.- OOP: Has slightly more code and is somewhat harder to work with(less functions used). However, it is able to check for garbage data. | Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init? | SQL INSERT inserts the profile into the table(sqlite.db) with the parameters entered. It is the same as init. | . import sqlite3 def create(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) college = input(&quot;Enter your college:&quot;) gpa = input(&quot;Enter your GPA:&quot;) sat = input(&quot;Enter your SAT score:&quot;) act = input(&quot;Enter your ACT score:&quot;) gradDate = input(&quot;Enter your date of graduation(&#39;MM-DD-YYYY&#39;):&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO students (_name, _college, _gpa, _sat, _act, _gradDate) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, college, gpa, sat, act, gradDate)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {name} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() # create() . A new user record has been created . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do? | If the new password inputted is less than 2 characters, the code detects it as a hack and a new password is automatically created for you. | Explain try/except, when would except occur? | Try attempts to execute the code under it. If there is an error with executing the code, except occurs and executes the below code. This is useful because you can write code that continues to run even after hitting a problem or error. | What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? | The code conn.cursor, cursor.execute, conn.commit, and cursor/conn.close is repeated. It is repeated because it constantly has to set up a cursor object and connection object. It has to be executed in order to do any actions, and must close at the end so that the code can end. | . import sqlite3 def update(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) college = input(&quot;Enter your college:&quot;) gpa = input(&quot;Enter your GPA:&quot;) sat = input(&quot;Enter your SAT score:&quot;) act = input(&quot;Enter your ACT score:&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE students SET _college = ?, _gpa = ?, _sat = ?, _act = ?

Profile with name has been updated . Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? | It is dangerous because once you delete an object, the object is gone forever. | In the print statemements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do? | &#39;f&#39; makes the variables in the {var} available to use. Without &#39;f&#39;, {var} would not work. {uid} is the string that is fetched from the database, it displays the uid being deleted. | . import sqlite3 def delete(): id = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM students WHERE id = ?&quot;, (id,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No id {id} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with id {id} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() # delete() . No id was not found in the table . Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat? | The menu repeats because the code never runs into an error. | Could you refactor this menu? Make it work with a List? | Yes. it could be CRUD = [c,r,u,d] | . def menu(): cruds = [&quot;c&quot;,&quot;r&quot;,&quot;u&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;s&quot;] operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete or (S)chema&quot;) if operation.lower() == cruds[0]: create() elif operation.lower() == cruds[1]: read() elif operation.lower() == cruds[2]: update() elif operation.lower() == cruds[3]: delete() elif operation.lower() == cruds[4]: schema() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . Profile with name John Mortensen has been updated . Hacks . Add this Blog to you own Blogging site. In the Blog add notes and observations on each code cell. | In this implementation, do you see procedural abstraction? | Yes. In menu, the function is called for CRUDS. Functions of connect, cursor, etc. are also being called. | In 2.4a or 2.4b lecture Do you see data abstraction? Complement this with Debugging example. | Yes. SQLite database is used. dictionaries are used. They are defined with parameters in init and are shown in columns. | Use Imperative or OOP style to Create a new Table or do something that applies to your CPT project. | . | .

Machine Learning Visit Tutorials Point . Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

The dictionary in the variable body helps to create separate, distinct packets of information specifically for one user.

The algorithm fetches the API using its URL to execute the GET method. It then checks that a successful fetch will be guaranteed, and if it is, then a response is carried out. An if statement is used to check if the response has an error with reading the database. If there is an error, an error message is displayed on the table of the leaderboard, and the entire function fetching the API is stopped. However, if there is no error, the algorithm proceeds to check that the response contains JSON data. If it does contain JSON data, the algorithm proceeds to sort the users, where the highest scoring user is displayed first and the lowest scoring user is displayed last. Next, a for loop is used so that only the top 5 scoring users are displayed onto the leaderboard, and their profiles are displayed by calling the add_row() function. Finally, the algorithm checks for any fetch errors, and if there is a fetch error, an error message is displayed onto the table of the leaderboard. . 3.d.i. .

It is not very harmful because different age groups tend to use different apps. There is not much harm with one age group using an app more often. However, for example, if an old person uses Tiktok, they might have a feeling of being excluded. It should be corrected because by accomodating all ages it can make everyone have a sense of belonging.

Internet blockers can help prevent people from gaming, watching videos and movies, and doing off-task activities during class. | The lack of admin passwords on computers at school can make signing into computers much more efficient without having to consistently ask an adult for the password. | . Cons: . Internet blockers can prevent students from using websites or apps related to school work. This can decrease the productivity in class activities as it is more of a hassle to work with website blockages. | The lack of admin passwords can also decrease the amount of security of the computer. This makes school computers more prone to hacking and unauthorized computer usage. | . My Concerns about the Digital Divide(5.2): . My concerns about the digital divide are the fact that society is starting to become more and more reliant on computers and similar machines. If people cannot access these kinds of technology, then they will fall more and more behind with education and work. The COVID pandemic is an example. If people do not have access to computers, then distance learning would be impossible and they would fall very behind on school work, leading to a bad education and a less successful career later on. My other concern about the digital divide is the fact that computers are very expensive. The cheapest computers are several hundred dollars, and if some families cannot afford computers, then they will fall behind in school and work. This will widen the rich-poor gap as those with low-incomes are increasingly at a disadvantage. These problems can be solved by sharing computers or donating computers to those who cannot afford them. .",

This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter).

(record below) . 3.18: Undecidable Problems . Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the concept of undecidable problems in computer science and to explain why these problems are important. . Key vocabulary: . Decision problem | Decidable problem | Undecidable problem | . Decision Problem . A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs:&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over: . Decidable Problems | Undecidable Problems | . A __ is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not. . An __ problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem. . Decidable Problems . A decidable problem is an algorithm that can always have an output of yes or no given any input. It is always correct. . Example of a Decidable Problem . The procedure below tests to see if a number is divisible by 13. If it is, it returns true. If it isn&#39;t, it returns false. . def divideThirteen(number): if number % 13 == 0: return True else: return False print(divideThirteen(26)) print(divideThirteen(30)) . True False . Undecidable Problems . An Example of a Forever Running Code . The code keeps adding 1 to the variable number until number is no longer an integer(This is not the python data type &quot;integer&quot;, it&#39;s the integer in number theory). However, there is no end to this code, making the computer run forever. There is no halt to the code. . i = 0 number = 1 def integerTest(n): # Testing if the number is an integer if n%1 ==0: return True else: return False # Using while loop to keep searching an a non-integer above 1. Note that the computer runs forever. while i == 0: number += 1 if integerTest(number) == False: i +=1 print(&quot;Done&quot;) . Delete the parentheses later below. . The Halting Problem . The halting problem is an example of an __(undecidable problem). It states that it is not always possible to correctly determine whether a code halts or runs forever. . There is __(no way) to write an algorithm to analyze and determine whether a body of code can run forever or not. . THe Halting Problem Example: . In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let&#39;s call this algorithm HaltChecker. | HaltChecker analyzes the program,program P, and its input,input I. If program P halts with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;halts&quot;. If program P doesn&#39;t halt(runs forever) with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. For example, in the code where it tests if variable number, the __(code runs forever), so HaltChecker returns an output of __(&quot;never&quot;). | Then, we add another algorithm called Reverser which reverses HaltChecker&#39;s output. So, if &quot;never&quot; is the output of HaltChecker, then the output of Reverser is __(&quot;halts&quot;). It&#39;s also the same the other way around: if HaltChecker has an output of &quot;halts&quot;, then Reverser has an output of __(&quot;never&quot;). | We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code. | Since Reverser is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints &quot;never&quot; when in fact there is an end(As proved by HaltChecker), and how it also prints &quot;halts&quot; when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by HaltChecker). As a result, HaltChecker is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem. | . This Diagram Sums up the Entire Process in the Bulleted List: . Credits of diagram and example to Khan Academy . FAQ . Q: If Reverser is causing the problem, why not remove it? | A: Removing Reverser will remove the problems, however, we are looking for ways which create the problem of not outputting a correct result. One example is enough to prove that it is an undecidable problem since it proves that the code is not completely accurate. | . Extra Things to Notice .

HP Inc.: Create technology that makes life better for everyone, every where. | Qualcomm: Investing the tech the world loves. | Thermo Fisher Scientific: Enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer. . | Thermo Fisher is the world leader in serving science | Our work right now can impact the market | Doing something impactful can be a factor when you choose your job | Roles of scrum master, devOps, frontend, and backend are related to real life work situations. | . Notes from presentation of a software engineer: . Your interests right now don’t determine what passions you have and job you want to do in the future. | Center for Embedded Network Sensors(CENS) | DevOps: Has a responsibility for security and preventing sites from getting hacked | Worst thing possible is to get bored of a job, you can learn stuff while working if the topics are interesting | Computer and tech jobs are in high demand | . Extra Notes: . Be flexible. According to the presenters, they have all switched to many jobs at different companies | The best workers listen to the requirements, and are able to translate the technology to how to solve the requirements | Qualcomm is a semiconductor industry | Qualcomm is the “big fish in a pond” | Being able to pass by completing coding tasks in 35-45 min is very hard but it is in the real world | If you know how to code, it’s a way of thinking. Coding teaches you how to do critical thinking and problem solving, and it’s important to know how you came up with your process and answer. | Example situation: You are in a room with only a notebook and pencil. You are asked, “how many cars are in the US?” The boss will look for the process of you getting an assumption, not how correct your answer is | Algorithms helps with trading stocks as you have to analyze patterns | . Summary and Lessons . I learned and explored the field of technology and software engineering. One interesting thing I learned was the the devOps responsibility is to maintain the security of the sites. I was not aware that security played a factor in creating coding projects. Another thing I learned is to be flexible. The presenters for today worked at many different jobs and switched majors as well as discovered new passions. Therefore, I shouldn’t be too stubborn and have an all-or-nothing mindset when finding out my major or jobs. I also learned about different major companies and how they operated. Thermo Fisher is the world’s largest supplier of science materials, and Qualcomm is also at one point the world’s largest supplier of phone chips. Finally, I learned that coding not only teaches me about coding, but it also teaches me skills of critical thinking, problem solving, and explanation of a process. Overall, this presentation I listened to today can help me with my future by teaching me important lessons of critical thinking, as well as being flexible with what I am passionate about. Most important lesson learned is continuous learning .",

            "content": "Calling Procedures . Slide 1: . A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programing language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called. | . Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a boolean or value, then you will assign that value to a variable | . Slide 3: . Assume the Temperature outside is Fahrenheit. | The procedure convertFahrenheit is intended to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius. | Convert the following pseudocode to python | . def convertFahrenheit(temp): # code goes here celsius = temp-32 celsius *= 5/9 return celsius outsideTemp = input(&quot;Input temp in celsius&quot;) outsideTemp = convertFahrenheit(int(outsideTemp)) print(outsideTemp) . 32.22222222222222 . Developing Procedures . Slide 8: . Picking a descriptive name is important in case you revisit the code later on (separate words with capitals) There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements Steps of developing procedure: picking a useful name, thinking of parameters (what data does the procedure need to know), making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure. . Slide 9: . In this example, a teacher is writing a program that will replace the grade on a previous quiz if the new grade is better than the previous. . What would be a good name for this procedure? | What parameters do we need for this procedure? | Try writing this procedure out in python based on the given pseudocode | . def quizCalc(quizGrade, currentPoints): currentGrade = int(currentPoints) / 40 currentGrade = currentGrade * 100 if currentGrade &gt; int(quizGrade): quizGrade = currentGrade return str(currentGrade) prevQuiz = input(&quot;Input your previous quiz score out of 40.&quot;) nowQuiz = input(&quot;Input your current quiz score out of 40.&quot;) print(&quot;Previous quiz score: &quot;, prevQuiz) print(&quot;Current quiz score: &quot;, nowQuiz) print(&quot;Current grade: &quot;, quizCalc(prevQuiz, nowQuiz)) . Previous quiz score: 30 Current quiz score: 35 Current grade: 87.5 . Procedural Abstraction . One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it | This is very helpful in managing complexity in a program | Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called modularity | A procedural abstraction may extract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity | When a pre-written procedure is called, you don’t necessarily need to know the details of this, just what it does and how to call it | Simply, procedural abstraction is naming and calling a prewritten procedure | Making sure to include the right arguments so the procedure can do what its supposed to do is crucial | . Complexity Example . One of the biggest advantages of procedural abstraction is managing complexity. . Think about the process of simplifying the code? What do you think the advantage of the code segment on the left is? . Code Segment 1 Code Segment 2 . ROTATE_LEFT() | detourLeft() | . MOVE_FORWARD()|turnCorner()| ROTATE_RIGHT |MOVE_FORWARD()| MOVE_FORWARD()|MOVE_FORWARD()| MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_RIGHT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() MOVE_FORWARD MOVE_FORWARD() . Hacks . Write a python procedure about something which can help you in school, for example the teacher’s function we spoke about earlier. | Points will be awarded based on creativity and functionality | 0.1 points will be deducted for late submissions | Submit the notes with all blanks filled in (scored out of 0.5 points) and the python procedure (scored out of 0.5 points) by Monday 12/12 at 11:59 PM. | .

The lesson will start off with introducing what algorithms are and what they do, moreover, what their significance is. . 3.9 Lesson 1 has the objective to teach the student of the outcome of similar algorithmic concepts and similar algorithms. In this lesson, you will see different ways on how algorithms are developed. . Lesson 1 | Defining Algorithms . What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed through CODE. There are set limitations, this is what makes algorithms fun, you can your imagination and create whatever you wan with your own instructions! . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks . | Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results. . | Some conditional statements can be written as the same as Boolean expressions (VICE VERSA) . | Different algorithms can be developed or use to solve the same problem. . | . Example 1 | What happens if we test the algorithm with different outputs? . The pseudocode above is translated to python for you. . Record what your outputs are when you enter 95 degrees F, does the algorithm yield the same result? . Both algorithms yield the same output when you enter 95 degrees F . The conditional below is nested . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then 95, what do you notice? . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then Input 95, what do you notice? . NOW RECORD with another output . Record what your outputs are when you enter 54, does the algorithm yield the same result this time? . *Now use 95 as an input for the two code blocks above. . Even though an algorithm&#39;s code can look the same, you have to be careful, they can always yield different results. When constructing algorithms you want to make sure that your code corresponds with what you want as your output. You set the limit of your code and you decide what the code&#39;s output is. . Conditionals vs. Booleans . The condition and instructions are what differ, that&#39;s where the magic happens. The condition is a boolean expression when an expression outputs either true or false. Boolean values are another type of data type in programming languages, and they can only ever hold true or false. . Exercise . Learning how to utilize conditionals and booleans are important for developing algorithms. Use this exercise to help you. . Can either Boolean expression on the right replace the conditional on the left? Assume isWeekday and isHoliday are Boolean variables. . *NOTE = you can edit the variables to check the conditions needed! . IsHoliday = False IsWeekday = True if IsHoliday: driveWork = True else: if IsWeekday: driveWork = True else: driveWork = False print(driveWork) . Logically thinking about conditionals and booleans . Now the problem may seem confusing, but the best way to develop an algorithm is to think about all the possible results that can be potentially be outputted. . So if IsHoliday is set to true, then driveWork is automatically equal to false and it does not matter what value of isWeekday is. This must mean that one of the conditionals must be NOT IsHoliday. . In the case that lets say IsHoliday is set to false, then the variable for weekday needs to be checked. If it&#39;s true then driveWork is true, if it&#39;s false then driveWork is false. This must mean that the other conditional isWeekday. . Combining both conditionals, you get option 2, which is not IsHoliday and IsWeekday. This is why option 2 is right! . Example 3 | Conditionals vs Booleans . The following algorithms are intended to sum the odd numbers from 1-9. Which algorithms work as intended? . Below, I have translated the block code into python, import this to your jupyter notebook and record the result. What do you notice? . First block . sum = 1 counter = 3 #iteration var = 0 while (var &lt; 4): #while the var is &lt;= 4, it executes those commands, once it exceeds it hits the else command sum = sum + counter counter = counter + 2 var = var + 1 # now go through the whole thing 4 times, this is an iteration, a vital part of algorithms. else: print(sum) . 25 . Second block . sum = 0 counter = 9 #iteration while (counter &gt;= 1): sum = sum + counter counter = counter - 2 print(sum) . 25 . When we start our initializing left sum as 1 counter as 3 we had no iterations yet. Remember we&#39;re going to have to repeat this four times because the block code prompts us to repeat 4 times, so we iterate. So as we go through and follow what the block gives us. . So you see that the sum does work, it does sum up the odd numbers from 1-9 . Now lets look at the right block. . Sum is set to 0 Counter is set to 9 We must repeat until the counter &lt; 1 is true. . So we keep adding until -1, that is when the counter &lt; 1 is true, so we stop . So why is it important to understand that algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same task? . An algorithm is beautiful that way, just because you think of solving a problem differently, doesn&#39;t mean your wrong, . 3.9 Part 2 . Flowcharts . Flowcharts can help you visualize the functionality of an algorithm . | They are a good way to double check whether or not your algorithm is achieving its purpose . | . How To Set Up A Flowchart . label the start point . | Define any and all variables you may need . | Consider the first question you want the algorithm to ask . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is yes (or true) . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is no (or false) . Steps 3-5 are the steps to creating code that uses a process called selection (you can convert the question from step 3 to a conditional if-statement in code) | . | Write out all necessary steps for the algorithm to function properly . | You may want your algorithm to iterate some steps until a condition is met . You can write the steps that need to be repeated, then draw an arrow from the last step to a step above that contains a conditional statement | . | determine a way to reach the end goal | Selection vs. Iteration . Selection: . A process used in algorithms where a conditional if-statement leads to one of two outcomes . Outcome 1: if the conditional statement is true, something will happen . | Outcome 2: if the conditional statement is false, something else will happen . | . | . | . Iteration . A process used in algorithms that allows certain things to happen until a condition is satisfied . Once the condition is satisfied, then an outcome is produced . | This can take the form of a for-loop, while-loop, and/or if-statement . | . | . | . Example A . Consider this situation: . You are shopping for your favorite food at your favorite supermarket . | You see that there is a sale on wheat products for 35% off . | There is another sale on produce for 20% off . | These sales are mutually exclusive . | Tax on all items is 8% . | . | Your TASK: . Create a flowchart for an algorithm that can be used to calculate the cost of your favorite item | . | . Example A Possible Solution (using Selection) . 3.9 Part 3 . For Algorithms How to combine and/or modify an existing algorithm. | . | . Benefits of combining algorithms can reduce development time, testing time, and simplify the identification of errors. | . | . Rules . step/rule 1: start with any positive integer | step/rule 2: if the preceding term is even; divide by 2 | step/rule 3: if the preceding term is odd; multiply by 3 and add 1 | step/rule 4: repeat steps until you arrive at 1 | fact: the sequence should ALWAYS end up at 1 if repeated. | . Algorithm to Start (Determining Whether a Number is Even or Odd) . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) if (varx %2 == 0): print(&quot;the number is even&quot;) else: print(&quot;the number is odd&quot;) # Run this cell to see how it works . choose value for x the number is even . How can we modify this code to match our goal . Hint: uses arithmetic operations | Hint: look at the steps of the equation and try and modify it to fit them | Must display all numbers used in it | . Solution . Step 1 . steps/rules 2 &amp; 3. | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) if (varx %2 == 0): varx == varx/2 # Change print to the function else: varx == varx * 3 + 1 # Change print to the function print(varx) . Step 2 . step/rule 4; here we add the loop | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) while varx != 1: if (varx %2 == 0): varx = varx/2 # Change print to the function else: varx = varx * 3 + 1 # Change print to the function print(varx) . Step 3 . Display all values throughout the algorithm | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) print(varx) while varx != 1: if (varx %2 == 0): varx = varx/2 print(varx) # add Display else: varx = varx * 3 + 1 print(varx) # add Display print(varx) # Final # Should be 1 every time . Takeaways . You can use code you&#39;ve previously wrote in order to make a project easier. | Breaking algorithms down into steps can make things easier and more simple. | . Hacks . create another algorithm using a famous mathematical algorithm such as the &quot;collatz conjecture.&quot; and explain your steps in a post on a blog. | . 3.11 Binary Search . Goals/Objectives: . detirmine number of iterations required to find vlue in data set. | explain requirements for binary search | . What is Binary Search? . Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. | An algorithm for iterating to find a value inside a data set | . About Binary Search: . Binary Search Algorithm starts in the middle of a data set of numbers and eliminates half the data. This process reapeats until the desired value is found or until all elements have been eliminated. | In order to use binary search effectivly and properly, data must be stored in order | COLLEGE BOARD INDEX STARTS AT 1 NOT 0 | . Think about how you would you would try to find a certain number in this set. . One way would be to line up the numbers and count them individually untill you find the desired value. . When working with large data sets with lots of numbers, methods like these wont work . Instead, a Binary Search would be more effective. | . Here we can see the numbers are set in an increasing order. Setting numbers in an increasing or decreasing is needed for a binary search . Binary search is started with the middle number first Middle number is found by taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two | . | Binary Search can be represented using a tree as shown below | . . Heres an easy way to put it: . binary search fidns the desired element by continuously chopping the search area in half | say the element you are looking for is &#39;f&#39; | . [a b c d e f g h] . We would start in the middle at element &#39;d&#39; | becuase our target is greater than d we will eliminate everything left of &#39;d&#39; including &#39;d&#39; (chopping it in half) . [e f g h] is what now remains . again we would &#39;chop in half&#39; | say we iterate through &#39;g&#39; and &#39;h&#39;, our desired element is still not found so we would eliminate &#39;g; and &#39;h&#39; and continue the process | . [e f] . now we are down to 2 elements | &#39;chopping in half&#39; will give us our desired element | . [f] . | . def BinarySearch(array, x, low, high): # Repeat until the pointers low and high meet each other while low &lt;= high: mid = low + (high - low)//2 # find the middle (taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two) if array[mid] == x: # if desired number is the middle is found return desired number (middle number) return mid elif array[mid] &lt; x: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 return -1 array = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] x = 4 result = BinarySearch(array, x, 0, len(array)-1) if result != -1: print(&quot;Element is present at index &quot; + str(result)) else: print(&quot;Not found&quot;) . Element is present at index 1 . We have created a function called binary_search() function which takes two arguments - a list to be sorted and a number to be searched. . | We have declared two variables to store the lowest and highest values in the list. The lowest is assigned initial value to 0, the highest to len(list1) 1 and mid as 0. . | Next, we have declared the while loop with the condition that the lowest is equal and smaller than the highest. The while loop will iterate if the number has not been found yet. . | In the while loop, we find the mid value and compare the index value to the number we are searching for. . | If the value of the mid-index is smaller than n, we increase the mid value by 1 and assign it to the low. The search moves to the left side. . | Otherwise, if the value of mid index is larger than n, we decrease the mid value by 1 and assign it to the high. The search moves to the right side. . | If the n is equal to the mid value then return mid. . | This will happen until the low is equal and smaller than the high. . | If we reach at the end of the function, then the element is not present in the list. We return -1 to the calling function. . | . . Hacks . Using my example above and steps below, create your own iteration using binary search . Steps . Compare x with the middle element. | If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index. | Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half. | Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half. | . import random x = random.seed(10,20) print(x) . None . Homework Assignment (DUE FRIDAY 12/09 BY 5:00 PM) . Consider this situation: .

It is usually formatted in the way below because a 2D array is meant to be 2-dimensional: . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Printing a 2D Array . We already know that we can&#39;t just print the matrix by calling it. We need to iterate through it to print it. . def print_matrix1(matrix): for i in range(len(matrix)): # outer for loop. This runs on i which represents the row. range(len(matrix)) is in order to iterate through the length of the matrix for j in range(len(matrix[i])): # inner for loop. This runs on the length of the i&#39;th row in the matrix (j changes for each row with a different length) print(matrix[i][j], end=&quot; &quot;) # [i][j] is the 2D location of that value in the matrix, kinda like a coordinate pair. [i] iterates to the specific row and [j] iterates to the specific value in the row. end=&quot; &quot; changes the end value to space, not a new line. print() # prints extra line. this is in the outer loop, not the inner loop, because it only wants to print a new line for each row . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] print(&quot;Raw matrix (list of lists): &quot;) print(keypad) print(&quot;Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration:&quot;) print_matrix1(keypad) print() . Raw matrix (list of lists): [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&#39; &#39;, 0, &#39; &#39;]] Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] def print_matrix2(matrix): for row in matrix: # Iterates through each &quot;row&quot; of matrix. Row is a dummy variable, it could technically be anything. It iterates through each value of matrix and each value is it&#39;s own list. in this syntax the list is stored in &quot;row&quot;. for col in row: # Iterates through each value in row. Again col, column, is a dummy variable. Each value in row is stored in col. print(col, end=&quot; &quot;) # Same as 1 print() # Same as 1 print_matrix2(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . More Functions . Try to find another way to print the matrix. Only complete one of the two (unless you&#39;d like to do both). Below is a hint . fruit = [&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;bananas&quot;, &quot;grapes&quot;] print(fruit) print(*fruit) # Python built in function: &quot;*&quot;. Figure out what it does . [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;bananas&#39;, &#39;grapes&#39;] apples bananas grapes . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] def print_matrix3(matrix): for i in matrix: print(*i) print_matrix3(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . Alternatively, find a way to print the matrix using the iter() function you already learned. Or use both! . def print_matrix4(matrix): code = &quot;your code goes here&quot; . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] . Print what month you were born and how old you are by iterating through the keyboard (don&#39;t just write a string). . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] def printMonthAge(matrix): j=0 q = matrix[0] w = matrix[1] e = matrix[2] r = matrix[3] t = e[6] + w[6] + r[5] + w[2] y = str(q[1]) + str(q[5]) while j==0: print(&quot;Month born: &quot;, t) print(&quot;Age: &quot;, y) j += 1 printMonthAge(keyboard) . Month born: JUNE Age: 15 . Challenge . Change all of the letters that you DIDN&#39;T print above to spaces, &quot; &quot;, and then print the full keyboard. (the things you did print should remain in the same spot) . Alternative Challenge: If you would prefer, animate it using some form of delay so it flashes one of your letters at a time on the board in order and repeats. (this one may be slightly more intuitive) . DO NOT HARD CODE THIS. Don&#39;t make it harder on yourself, iterate through, make it abstract so it can be used dynamically. You should be able to input any string and your code should work. . Note: This is my work for the code. I don&#39;t think it works because the code is not displaying anything. At this point, I am stuck and I don&#39;t know what to do now. . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] def printMonthAge(matrix): q = matrix[0] w = matrix[1] e = matrix[2] r = matrix[3] p = 0 j = 0 g = 0 f = 0 testV = 0 # for i in matrix: while j &lt; 13: if q[j] != q[1]: q[j] = &quot; &quot; else: testV +=1 j += 1 # p += 1 while g &lt; 12: if w[f] != w[1]: w[f] = &quot; &quot; else: testV +=1 g += 1 # f += 1 while p &lt; 11: if e[p] != e[1]: e[p] = &quot; &quot; else: testV +=1 p += 1 # o += 1 while f &lt; 10: if r[f] != r[1]: r[f] = &quot; &quot; else: testV +=1 f += 1 # a += 1 # print(*i) iter(matrix) printMonthAge(keyboard) . . 1 6 R A H C M . If you get stuck you can just make a picture with an array and print it (I will grade based on how good it looks) .

However, you can lead from any position. | Don’t think that you are incapable of running a leadership position. | Keep the end result in mind | Don’t blindly follow something, be curious and question what you do | You can learn more stuff from going to a teacher’s classroom in office hours | Building skills with technical feats along with making friends is a way to success | Stanford’s computer science program helps build skills for success | When you get an opportunity, take it and do something about it, don’t dismiss it | Your value is your perspective, not just how much you know about coding | Your perspective provides the most value for the team | Interview should be more of a conversation | You will fail more than you succeed, the more you fail, the more you will learn which is better than succeeding all the time | . Paragraph . I learned that I should become more future-focused and don’t be afraid to try new things. I should focus more on the end goal, and think about what I can achieve with it. I should keep persisting and not be afraid to fail, since failing only makes me wiser and increases my chance of success. In the presentation, one of the tenants mentioned how it’s important to take opportunities. The speaker was afraid of taking a leadership position, but she was encouraged to, and ended up becoming successful. Therefore, I should also take advantage of opportunities later on when they come. Computer science is also not just all about coding, it’s more about my perspective in the team. So, while I should be learning more about coding, I should also be aware of my opinions and what I feel is good for the team. Stanford’s computer science program is especially good at helping to develop important life skills for the future. I learned also to think more critically about my actions and future, so then I can be aware of what I am doing and not blindly follow a path. .",

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. &quot;&quot;&quot; import requests url = &quot;https://cost-of-living-and-prices.p.rapidapi.com/cities&quot; headers = { &quot;X-RapidAPI-Key&quot;: &quot;hi&quot;, &quot;X-RapidAPI-Host&quot;: &quot;hi&quot; } response = requests.request(&quot;GET&quot;, url, headers=headers) print(response.text) # # This code looks for &quot;house types&quot; # print(&quot;House Type: &quot;) # names = response.json().get(&#39;homeType&#39;) # turn response to json() so we can extract &quot;homeType&quot; # for key in names.items(): # this finds key, value pairs in country # print(key) # # print() # This code looks for San Diego result = response.json().get(&#39;cities&#39;) for re in result: if re[&quot;city_name&quot;] == &quot;San Diego&quot;: for key, value in re.items(): print(key, value) # print(&quot;Condos: &quot;) # condos = response.json().get(&#39;homeType&#39;) # for condo in condos: # if condo[&quot;homeType&quot;] == &quot;CONDO&quot;: # for key, value in condo.items(): # print(key, value) . Digital Coin Example . This example provides digital coin feedback (ie Bitcoin). It include popularity, price, symbols, etc. . A valid X-RapidAPI-Key is required. Look in code for link to RapidAPI page | Read all comments in code for further guidance | . # RapidAPI page https://rapidapi.com/Coinranking/api/coinranking1/ # Begin Rapid API Code import requests url = &quot;https://coinranking1.p.rapidapi.com/coins&quot; querystring = {&quot;referenceCurrencyUuid&quot;:&quot;yhjMzLPhuIDl&quot;,&quot;timePeriod&quot;:&quot;24h&quot;,&quot;tiers[0]&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;orderBy&quot;:&quot;marketCap&quot;,&quot;orderDirection&quot;:&quot;desc&quot;,&quot;limit&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:&quot;0&quot;} headers = { &quot;X-RapidAPI-Key&quot;: &quot;jcmbea0fa2ff5msh7f14bf69be38ca6p175482jsn6c4988114560&quot;, # place your key here &quot;X-RapidAPI-Host&quot;: &quot;coinranking1.p.rapidapi.com&quot; } response = requests.request(&quot;GET&quot;, url, headers=headers, params=querystring) print(response.text) # End Rapid API Code json = response.json() # convert response to python json object # Observe data from an API.

Our plan is to create a managing and planning system using data from Canvas. We will try to use Canvas’s API(It is public and we are allowed to use it) to recieve information on peoples’ assignments, events, etc. Our purpose of creating this is to help make students’ planners easy to make, as well as helping them to be more organized while also saving time by using an automated system to help do the planning for them. . Row 1: Program Purpose and Function . Our program’s purpose is to provide an automated organizer for students’ tasks. The function is to utilize a calendar and allow students to add, remove, and edit events on each day. Students will also be able to sign in with their own account in order to save their events. . Row 2: Data Abstraction . The data will be a list which includes a students’ events. As a student adds, removes, or edits an event, the list will change. The name of the variable representing the list will be calendarEvent, or some variable related to events on a calendar. . Row 3: Managing Complexity . We can manage the complexity by creating a new list specific to each user. Then, we can create a list of all the users, making the entire project easy to manage. . Row 4: Procedural Abstraction . My student-developed procedure is to make the login screen for the website. I will also help to log all of the information entered by the users when they first use the scheduler. . Row 5: Algorithm Implementation . While we have not started on the project yet, our plan is to make a list inside of a list, etc. The list can be appended by using a while loop. . Row 6: Testing . After making slight changes, I will test the code by using a local server. I will do it very often in order to make sure that everything is working before I move onto a new task. .",

            "content": "Blog Reflections . Me and my partner, Noor, have decided on making a math quiz on applab for the week 4 requirement. We plan on using basic math questions to test out applabs developer tool. We will use the given code blocks and experiment around to find the proper layout for the quiz we want. We plan on them that they are guaranteed a 0% on their next math test. It is what it is. We will also add a rickroll at the end of the quiz. Some struggles that we faced were how to record the score for the quiz. It took us a while, but we managed to add the score to the quiz. I also originally wanted to add an error screen when you got a question wrong, but it did not work out very well, so we just added a sound effect instead. One way that I worked with data is to store a variable for the score of the quiz. The base score is 3, and each incorrect selection subtracts a point. The quiz code was also placed in chronological order, going from clicking functions for the title screen to the end of the quiz. This is because java runs from top to bottom, so coding from the bottom to the top would possibly lead to errors. . It was challenging to put all those semicolons at the end of every line. The commands were also slightly different from python, preventing the code from being very straightforward. . Some ideas for the college board create task is to make an AI quiz, which can start to learn your own learning preferences. . .",

            "content": "Insights and Takeaways from the Panel . I learned that computer science is perfect for those who like problem solving. I am personally okay with it, so I’m pretty sure computer science is good for me. I also learned that having logical thinking is crucial for engineering majors, and this is especially true when you have to code in these majors, since coding requires step-by-step logic. Computer science is very important to use in real world situations, since it is used everywhere as the world relies more on the internet. Therefore, if one wants to make an impact, then they should learn computer science well. When it comes to learning CSP at DNHS, I learned that I should use Google more often when researching for the correct syntax. This way, it is much more efficient, and I don’t have to be asking others online and waiting forever for a reponse. It’s also best not to cut corners and not just do things for points. By doing things just for a grade, it takes away the purpose of learning, which isn’t really good in the long run. I also shouldn’t give up when running into problems with the code. While I do think that I have done a pretty good job in this area, I believe that I can still improve by changing my mindset so I don’t always get so frustrated when running into a problem. One of the biggest challenges is getting started with computer science, which I believe a lot after going through the first few weeks of school. However, I believe that I should keep pushing and not give up. The takeaway that I believe is the most important is to not compare yourselves to others. Del Norte is a very competitive school, therefore, there’s a lot of pressure to keep up with other people. But, by doing so, it only wastes your time from doing things that you are passionate about, and puts a lot of unnecessary stress on yourself. As a result, the main takeaway is that I should focus on what I like to do, and once I do it well, then I will be able to stand out from others in a unique way. .",

Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The video clearly shows its functionality, inputs, and outputs, and the purpose is valid. The functionality of the code was also written well. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 1 | A function is stated instead of a list. The second code segment also looks oddly similar to a for loop in the first code segment, which is very suspicious that they might’ve been copying and pasting code but switching variables for no apparent reason. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The list seems to manage complexity, and the explanation clearly explains the result of not having the list mentioned. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The two code segments successfully show a procedure and it being called. Its description is adequate but is also slightly vague. However, I don’t think a point would be lost because it isn’t too vague. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Many if statements are used, showing a lot of sequencing, selection, and iteration. The steps of the algorithm are explained in a lot of detail. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The testing has valid calls, conditions, and results. | . Submission 3: . Reporting Category Student Grading Score Collegeboard’s Score Comments . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The purpose is well stated and program functionality, input, and output are clearly shown in both the video and the written description. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The list is applied to the program’s purpose, but the first code segment does not really show the list with data being stored into it. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 0 | The list was shown to manage complexity by making the code more efficient. The result of not using the list is also clearly explained. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | A procedure is shown in the first code segment but it is missing parameters. A different function is called in the second code segment. | . Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | Lots of if and else if statements were used, showing lots of sequencing, selection, and iteration. However, the steps for making the algorithm is too vague. | . Testing | 1 | 0 | All the calls, conditions, and results are clearly stated and the calls are not outputs. | . Submission 4: . Reporting Category Student Grading Score Collegeboard’s Score Comments . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The video demonstrated input, functionality, and output, the purpose was clear, and the inputs and outputs were stated in great detail. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The list has been shown by how data has been stored in it, and is shown fullfilling the program’s purpose of catching fish. The written description of the list is also clear and concise. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | List is shown to manage complexity in the code segment and is well described. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 1 | The procedure is shown and is called, but the parameters are very weird and I’m not sure if that’s the proper way to use parameters. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | For loops and if statements are used, demonstrating sequencing, selection, and iteration. The described steps are also detailed enough to be able to know every part of the procedure. | . Testing | 1 | 0 | The two calls use different arguments and use the procedure in 3c. The conditions and results are explained in adequate detail. | . Reflection: . As a final summary, by combining all the CPT scorings I’ve done, the most important lesson would be that I do not have to be extremely detailed when answering some questions. This is because I am a very detail-oriented person, and I always try to make things as detailed as possible. However, based on the CPT scorings, I’ve noticed patterns where you do not have to be extremely detailed(such as in identifying the purpose or list as well as describing the functionality). But, there are some parts where great detail is necessary, such as when explaining the steps of an algorithm and describing the identified procedure. Based on the scorings for just the CPT scoring part 3, I’ve noticed that lists and procedures can have data stored in it and have it called in many creative ways. For example, submission 1 did not just outright show a list being created. Instead, it had data stored inside of a procedure, which demonstrates creativity and innovation. I also learned that the testing should refer specifically to the code and not just on what the user sees when using the program. In addition, the arguments should have specific values and the conditions should be related to the parameter or arguments. If no value is given to the parameters, it is likely that a person will be stating the functionality of the code rather than an actual tested value. .",

Reflection: . For most of the time, I gave a point while Collegeboard did not give one. This was because I did not read their descriptions in great detail. I was only looking for key words in their descriptions. This means that I should be more detailed next time to find any problems with the submission’s descriptions. Overall, I think that my program should be very detailed in order to ensure that I get the maximum possible points. The submissions that got low scores had very vague descriptions, while the submissions that got high scores had very detailed descriptions. For the last submission, the testing part failed to meet the standard because it tested for one thing and gave two possible outputs. However, these are outputs and are not two different calls to the function. .",

For Submission 1, Collegeboard did not give the point for Program Pupose and Function because the purpose was not valid. However, I did award a point thinking that the purpose was good enough. This means that when I submit my project to Collegeboard, I should go deeper in the purpose and not just specify the overall function of the program(While also keeping it concise to about 1 sentence). For Submission 2, I did not give a point for Data Abstraction because I thought that you needed to take a screenshot of the variable of the list for the code segment. However, Collegeboard did give the point for Data Abstraction because the code segments did show the use of the lists. While the list wasn’t directly stated in the code segment, the code segment still shows the utilization of the lists which makes this category valid for a point. Also, the names of the lists were specified in 3.b.iii so the grader knows which variables are lists in the code. Therefore, a point for Data Abstraction was awarded. This tells to me that I should show the utilization of a list in the code segments rather than just showing the creation of the variable of the list. Overall, through grading these submissions, I realized that for much of 3a I do not have to write up a whole paragraph for each subsection. I am now aware that I should be more detailed in the code segments and on explaining the code when I will be making my project. .",
