            "content": "Do Now!!! . Set up your notebook by either wgetting the lesson or tracking it by your own (We would recommend wgetting since there are some fill in the blanks!) | . 3.17: Algorithm Efficiency . Purpose: . Traveling Merchant Problem Hacks: . What did you and your team discuss? (record below) . An __ solution is __ that produces a solution that isn&#39;t necessarily _ but can be used when normal methods take forever | . Describe the method used to solve the traveling merchant problem. (record below) . 3.18: Undecidable Problems . Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the concept of undecidable problems in computer science and to explain why these problems are important. . Key vocabulary: . Decision problem | Decidable problem | Undecidable problem | . Decision Problem . A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs:&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over: . Decidable Problems | Undecidable Problems | . A __ is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not. . An __ problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem. . Decidable Problems . A decidable problem is an algorithm that can always have an output of yes or no given any input. It is always correct. . Example of a Decidable Problem . The procedure below tests to see if a number is divisible by 13. If it is, it returns true. If it isn&#39;t, it returns false. . def divideThirteen(number): if number % 13 == 0: return True else: return False print(divideThirteen(26)) print(divideThirteen(30)) . True False . Undecidable Problems . An Example of a Forever Running Code . The code keeps adding 1 to the variable number until number is no longer an integer(This is not the python data type &quot;integer&quot;, it&#39;s the integer in number theory). However, there is no end to this code, making the computer run forever. There is no halt to the code. . i = 0 number = 1 def integerTest(n): # Testing if the number is an integer if n%1 ==0: return True else: return False # Using while loop to keep searching an a non-integer above 1. Note that the computer runs forever. while i == 0: number += 1 if integerTest(number) == False: i +=1 print(&quot;Done&quot;) . Delete the parentheses later below. . The Halting Problem . The halting problem is an example of an __(undecidable problem). It states that it is not always possible to correctly determine whether a code halts or runs forever. . There is __(no way) to write an algorithm to analyze and determine whether a body of code can run forever or not. . THe Halting Problem Example: . In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let&#39;s call this algorithm HaltChecker. | HaltChecker analyzes the program,program P, and its input,input I. If program P halts with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;halts&quot;. If program P doesn&#39;t halt(runs forever) with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. For example, in the code where it tests if variable number, the __(code runs forever), so HaltChecker returns an output of __(&quot;never&quot;). | Then, we add another algorithm called Reverser which reverses HaltChecker&#39;s output. So, if &quot;never&quot; is the output of HaltChecker, then the output of Reverser is __(&quot;halts&quot;). It&#39;s also the same the other way around: if HaltChecker has an output of &quot;halts&quot;, then Reverser has an output of __(&quot;never&quot;). | We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code. | Since Reverser is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints &quot;never&quot; when in fact there is an end(As proved by HaltChecker), and how it also prints &quot;halts&quot; when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by HaltChecker). As a result, HaltChecker is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem. | . This Diagram Sums up the Entire Process in the Bulleted List: . Credits of diagram and example to Khan Academy . FAQ . Q: If Reverser is causing the problem, why not remove it? | A: Removing Reverser will remove the problems, however, we are looking for ways which create the problem of not outputting a correct result. One example is enough to prove that it is an undecidable problem since it proves that the code is not completely accurate. | . Extra Things to Notice . Note that while a computer may take a long time to run a section of code, it does not mean that the computer is going to run forever. | Humans are able to solve some undecidable problems. The entire Halting Problem example was to prove that computers cannot solve undecidable problems. | . Hacks . Come up with one situation in which a computer runs into an undecidable problem. Explain why it is considered an undecidable problem. . 3.17 Homework . Your homework for Algorithmic Efficiency is pretty simple. .

After finishing the snake game by hitting the wall or the snake itself, a form is displayed to allow the user to input their username. After the form is complete, the data is added into the database and is displayed on the leaderboard. . 3.a.iii. . After the snake game is over, the user inputs a three-letter username. The score is automatically inputted for the user. The outcome of the program is a table of the five top scorers, displaying the username, score, and date of the game. . 3.b.i. . . 3.b.ii. . . 3.b.iii. . The variable, or constant is body is the name of the dictionary. . 3.b.iv. . The variable body obtains the data values from the username input and the score, representing the details of the user’s profile. . 3.b.v. . The dictionary in the variable body helps to create separate, distinct packets of information specifically for one user. Without the use of this dictionary, the database would not be able to distinguish which score corresponds to which username. This can make the program code harder to create as there would have to be a separate, more complex algorithm which manually sorts the data already present in the database. . 3.c.i. . . 3.c.ii. . . 3.c.iii. . The procedure add_row() adds a row on the table of the leaderboard, and displays the username, score, and date based on the user’s inputs and the data from the API. This helps to display the data from user inputs onto the leaderboard so that other users are able to see the top scorers of the game. . 3.c.iv. . The algorithm fetches the API using its URL to execute the GET method. It then checks that a successful fetch will be guaranteed, and if it is, then a response is carried out. An if statement is used to check if the response has an error with reading the database. If there is an error, an error message is displayed on the table of the leaderboard, and the entire function fetching the API is stopped. However, if there is no error, the algorithm proceeds to check that the response contains JSON data. If it does contain JSON data, the algorithm proceeds to sort the users, where the highest scoring user is displayed first and the lowest scoring user is displayed last. Next, a for loop is used so that only the top 5 scoring users are displayed onto the leaderboard, and their profiles are displayed by calling the add_row() function. Finally, the algorithm checks for any fetch errors, and if there is a fetch error, an error message is displayed onto the table of the leaderboard. . 3.d.i. . First Call: The first call is when the user clicks on the leaderboard website, which calls the function that fetches the API with a functional URL. . Second Call: The second call is when the user clicks on the leaderboard website, which calls the function that fetches the API while the URL is down.’ . Condition(s) tested by first call: The first call checks the errors and successfully determines that there are no errors with fetching the data. As a result, the data from the user input is sorted based on the user’s score using the response.json().then() command. . Condition(s) tested by second call: The second call checks fetch errors using the .catch() command. Since the URL to the API is down, a fetch error will prompt the .catch() command to function. . Results of first call: The first call displays the user onto the leaderboard given that it is a top five scorer. . Results of the second call: An error message is displayed on the leaderboard and no user data is displayed. .",

Some PII I have seen on my CPT project are the username, and user history for accessing the games. | I believe that some aspects of PII are needed to make certain functions on websites or organizations to work.

If some PII are not needed, then it certainly shouldn’t be asked for. I believe that my personal exposure is more on the secretive or defensive side.

I looked at the URL and later noticed that it was completely different from McAfee’s official website, so I realized that it was a phishing scheme.

The data says that Tiktok is more appealing to teenagers and kids than Facebook does. There is a slight exclusion in these platforms as the colorful backgrounds in Tiktok creates the impression that it’s only suitable for young people. It is not very harmful because different age groups tend to use different apps. There is not much harm with one age group using an app more often. However, for example, if an old person uses Tiktok, they might have a feeling of being excluded. It should be corrected because by accomodating all ages it can make everyone have a sense of belonging. It is good business to correct it because then more and more people from different age groups will use the app. . Virtual assistants have female voices because of societal standards, which suggests that females should be of service to males. It is harmful because it puts females at an inferior position to males. It should be corrected in order to prevent people from thinking that gender determines your social hierarchy.

Internet blockers can help prevent people from gaming, watching videos and movies, and doing off-task activities during class. | The lack of admin passwords on computers at school can make signing into computers much more efficient without having to consistently ask an adult for the password. | . Cons: . Internet blockers can prevent students from using websites or apps related to school work. This can decrease the productivity in class activities as it is more of a hassle to work with website blockages. | The lack of admin passwords can also decrease the amount of security of the computer. This makes school computers more prone to hacking and unauthorized computer usage. | . My Concerns about the Digital Divide(5.2): . My concerns about the digital divide are the fact that society is starting to become more and more reliant on computers and similar machines. If people cannot access these kinds of technology, then they will fall more and more behind with education and work. The COVID pandemic is an example. If people do not have access to computers, then distance learning would be impossible and they would fall very behind on school work, leading to a bad education and a less successful career later on. My other concern about the digital divide is the fact that computers are very expensive. The cheapest computers are several hundred dollars, and if some families cannot afford computers, then they will fall behind in school and work. This will widen the rich-poor gap as those with low-incomes are increasingly at a disadvantage. These problems can be solved by sharing computers or donating computers to those who cannot afford them. .",

The algorithm is choosing which numbers are even. This requires selection. . Question 22 . . Both algorithms work because algorithm A adds all the students’ values and discards the previously added value.

Row 1: Purpose and function . Purpose: To provide a user-friendly interaction through competition. . Video Plan: . I first finish playing a quick round of snake, input into the table, and then go to the page with the leaderboard. The input will be the table, the output will be the leaderboard. The program functionalty could be on postman? I’m not extremely sure about how to show the functionality. So video is still under development. . Row 2: Data Abstraction . First code segment will show the list json_ready in the class ScoreListAPI in score.py in api folder. | The second code segment will be right below the list and will show all code below where it says return jsonify(json_ready). | The data in this list contains all the data for the scores and profile entered. | . Row 3: Managing Complexity . Manages complexity by auto-generating all of the data into one single list | If this list didn’t exist, then all of the data entered would have to be processed individually which requires an huge amount of unnecessary code | . Row 4: Procedural Abstraction . All the procedures(functions) lack a proper parameter. However, I would choose the create(self) function in model folder in scores.py as the first code segment. | I will also show it being called in api folder in score.py in line 37 and in the if user: statement. | Contributes to overall functionality because it helps create the data entered in the table in a json format. | . Row 5: Algorithm Implementation . I would add the def initScores() code segment in model folder in scores.py | Function creates test database and tables, users are inputted with the parameters, and put into a list. For loop is used to add the data to the table. Try and except statements are also used. | . Row 6: Testing . Calls: One is to input the data in the table, the other is to delete one row of data | Conditions: create() function used for creating new data, delete() function to delete the existing data. | Result: Describe changes to the table. | . Note: Our project lacks enough things for at least four different CPT projects. There are ideas to create more games that are underway, but have not been fully implemented yet. .",

            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

HP Inc.: Create technology that makes life better for everyone, every where. | Qualcomm: Investing the tech the world loves. | Thermo Fisher Scientific: Enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer. . | Thermo Fisher is the world leader in serving science | Our work right now can impact the market | Doing something impactful can be a factor when you choose your job | Roles of scrum master, devOps, frontend, and backend are related to real life work situations. | . Notes from presentation of a software engineer: . Your interests right now don’t determine what passions you have and job you want to do in the future. | Center for Embedded Network Sensors(CENS) | DevOps: Has a responsibility for security and preventing sites from getting hacked | Worst thing possible is to get bored of a job, you can learn stuff while working if the topics are interesting | Computer and tech jobs are in high demand | . Extra Notes: . Be flexible. According to the presenters, they have all switched to many jobs at different companies | The best workers listen to the requirements, and are able to translate the technology to how to solve the requirements | Qualcomm is a semiconductor industry | Qualcomm is the “big fish in a pond” | Being able to pass by completing coding tasks in 35-45 min is very hard but it is in the real world | If you know how to code, it’s a way of thinking. Coding teaches you how to do critical thinking and problem solving, and it’s important to know how you came up with your process and answer. | Example situation: You are in a room with only a notebook and pencil. You are asked, “how many cars are in the US?” The boss will look for the process of you getting an assumption, not how correct your answer is | Algorithms helps with trading stocks as you have to analyze patterns | . Summary and Lessons . I learned and explored the field of technology and software engineering. One interesting thing I learned was the the devOps responsibility is to maintain the security of the sites. I was not aware that security played a factor in creating coding projects. Another thing I learned is to be flexible. The presenters for today worked at many different jobs and switched majors as well as discovered new passions. Therefore, I shouldn’t be too stubborn and have an all-or-nothing mindset when finding out my major or jobs. I also learned about different major companies and how they operated. Thermo Fisher is the world’s largest supplier of science materials, and Qualcomm is also at one point the world’s largest supplier of phone chips. Finally, I learned that coding not only teaches me about coding, but it also teaches me skills of critical thinking, problem solving, and explanation of a process. Overall, this presentation I listened to today can help me with my future by teaching me important lessons of critical thinking, as well as being flexible with what I am passionate about. Most important lesson learned is continuous learning .",

Simulations in the wild . Simulations are used extremely frequently in real life applications. One of the most common examples of simulations are video games. A games physics engine can accurately simulate objects colliding . Another example is Blender, the software used in 3d animations class, here at Del Norte. Blender is made up of many small simulations, but one big one it uses is simulating the way light bounces off of and interacts with objects. . HW !!! . Create a simulation. It can be anything, just has to simulate something. . Some ideas: . Two objects colliding | Gravity on other planets | . AND . Find an example of a simulation in a software/game you use, screenshot, and explain how it is a simulation . Simulation: . This simulation calculates the the gravitational force between two objects. . mass1 = input(&quot;Enter mass of first object&quot;) mass2 = input(&quot;Enter mass of second object&quot;) radius = input(&quot;Enter distance between the centers of the masses&quot;) radiusCalc = int(radius)^2 force = 6.67e-11*((int(mass1)*int(mass2))/radiusCalc) print(&quot;Gravitational force between the two objects: &quot;, force, &quot;Newtons&quot;) . Gravitational force between the two objects: 1.0435787647701199e+19 Newtons .

A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programing language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called. | . Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a boolean or value, then you will assign that value to a variable | . Slide 3: .

Developing Procedures . Slide 8: . Picking a descriptive name is important in case you revisit the code later on (separate words with capitals) There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements Steps of developing procedure: picking a useful name, thinking of parameters (what data does the procedure need to know), making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure. . Slide 9: . In this example, a teacher is writing a program that will replace the grade on a previous quiz if the new grade is better than the previous. .

Previous quiz score: 30 Current quiz score: 35 Current grade: 87.5 . Procedural Abstraction . One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it | This is very helpful in managing complexity in a program | Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called modularity | A procedural abstraction may extract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity | When a pre-written procedure is called, you don’t necessarily need to know the details of this, just what it does and how to call it | Simply, procedural abstraction is naming and calling a prewritten procedure | Making sure to include the right arguments so the procedure can do what its supposed to do is crucial | . Complexity Example . One of the biggest advantages of procedural abstraction is managing complexity. . Think about the process of simplifying the code? What do you think the advantage of the code segment on the left is? . Code Segment 1 Code Segment 2 . ROTATE_LEFT() | detourLeft() | . MOVE_FORWARD()|turnCorner()| ROTATE_RIGHT |MOVE_FORWARD()| MOVE_FORWARD()|MOVE_FORWARD()| MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_RIGHT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() MOVE_FORWARD MOVE_FORWARD() . Hacks . Write a python procedure about something which can help you in school, for example the teacher’s function we spoke about earlier. | Points will be awarded based on creativity and functionality | 0.1 points will be deducted for late submissions | Submit the notes with all blanks filled in (scored out of 0.5 points) and the python procedure (scored out of 0.5 points) by Monday 12/12 at 11:59 PM. | .

The lesson will start off with introducing what algorithms are and what they do, moreover, what their significance is. . 3.9 Lesson 1 has the objective to teach the student of the outcome of similar algorithmic concepts and similar algorithms. In this lesson, you will see different ways on how algorithms are developed. . Lesson 1 | Defining Algorithms . What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed through CODE. There are set limitations, this is what makes algorithms fun, you can your imagination and create whatever you wan with your own instructions! . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks . | Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results. . | Some conditional statements can be written as the same as Boolean expressions (VICE VERSA) . | Different algorithms can be developed or use to solve the same problem. . | . Example 1 | What happens if we test the algorithm with different outputs? . The pseudocode above is translated to python for you. . Record what your outputs are when you enter 95 degrees F, does the algorithm yield the same result? . Both algorithms yield the same output when you enter 95 degrees F . The conditional below is nested . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then 95, what do you notice? . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then Input 95, what do you notice? . NOW RECORD with another output . Record what your outputs are when you enter 54, does the algorithm yield the same result this time? . *Now use 95 as an input for the two code blocks above. . Even though an algorithm&#39;s code can look the same, you have to be careful, they can always yield different results. When constructing algorithms you want to make sure that your code corresponds with what you want as your output. You set the limit of your code and you decide what the code&#39;s output is. . Conditionals vs. Booleans . The condition and instructions are what differ, that&#39;s where the magic happens. The condition is a boolean expression when an expression outputs either true or false. Boolean values are another type of data type in programming languages, and they can only ever hold true or false. . Exercise . Learning how to utilize conditionals and booleans are important for developing algorithms. Use this exercise to help you. . Can either Boolean expression on the right replace the conditional on the left? Assume isWeekday and isHoliday are Boolean variables. . *NOTE = you can edit the variables to check the conditions needed! . IsHoliday = False IsWeekday = True if IsHoliday: driveWork = True else: if IsWeekday: driveWork = True else: driveWork = False print(driveWork) . Logically thinking about conditionals and booleans . Now the problem may seem confusing, but the best way to develop an algorithm is to think about all the possible results that can be potentially be outputted. . So if IsHoliday is set to true, then driveWork is automatically equal to false and it does not matter what value of isWeekday is. This must mean that one of the conditionals must be NOT IsHoliday. . In the case that lets say IsHoliday is set to false, then the variable for weekday needs to be checked. If it&#39;s true then driveWork is true, if it&#39;s false then driveWork is false. This must mean that the other conditional isWeekday. . Combining both conditionals, you get option 2, which is not IsHoliday and IsWeekday. This is why option 2 is right! . Example 3 | Conditionals vs Booleans . The following algorithms are intended to sum the odd numbers from 1-9. Which algorithms work as intended? . Below, I have translated the block code into python, import this to your jupyter notebook and record the result. What do you notice? . First block . sum = 1 counter = 3 #iteration var = 0 while (var &lt; 4): #while the var is &lt;= 4, it executes those commands, once it exceeds it hits the else command sum = sum + counter counter = counter + 2 var = var + 1 # now go through the whole thing 4 times, this is an iteration, a vital part of algorithms. else: print(sum) . 25 . Second block . sum = 0 counter = 9 #iteration while (counter &gt;= 1): sum = sum + counter counter = counter - 2 print(sum) . 25 . When we start our initializing left sum as 1 counter as 3 we had no iterations yet. Remember we&#39;re going to have to repeat this four times because the block code prompts us to repeat 4 times, so we iterate. So as we go through and follow what the block gives us. . So you see that the sum does work, it does sum up the odd numbers from 1-9 . Now lets look at the right block. . Sum is set to 0 Counter is set to 9 We must repeat until the counter &lt; 1 is true. . So we keep adding until -1, that is when the counter &lt; 1 is true, so we stop . So why is it important to understand that algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same task? . An algorithm is beautiful that way, just because you think of solving a problem differently, doesn&#39;t mean your wrong, . 3.9 Part 2 . Flowcharts . Flowcharts can help you visualize the functionality of an algorithm . | They are a good way to double check whether or not your algorithm is achieving its purpose . | . How To Set Up A Flowchart . label the start point . | Define any and all variables you may need . | Consider the first question you want the algorithm to ask . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is yes (or true) . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is no (or false) . Steps 3-5 are the steps to creating code that uses a process called selection (you can convert the question from step 3 to a conditional if-statement in code) | . | Write out all necessary steps for the algorithm to function properly . | You may want your algorithm to iterate some steps until a condition is met . You can write the steps that need to be repeated, then draw an arrow from the last step to a step above that contains a conditional statement | . | determine a way to reach the end goal | Selection vs. Iteration . Selection: . A process used in algorithms where a conditional if-statement leads to one of two outcomes . Outcome 1: if the conditional statement is true, something will happen . | Outcome 2: if the conditional statement is false, something else will happen . | . | . | . Iteration . A process used in algorithms that allows certain things to happen until a condition is satisfied . Once the condition is satisfied, then an outcome is produced . | This can take the form of a for-loop, while-loop, and/or if-statement . | . | . | . Example A . Consider this situation: . You are shopping for your favorite food at your favorite supermarket . | You see that there is a sale on wheat products for 35% off . | There is another sale on produce for 20% off . | These sales are mutually exclusive . | Tax on all items is 8% . | . | Your TASK: . Create a flowchart for an algorithm that can be used to calculate the cost of your favorite item | . | . Example A Possible Solution (using Selection) . 3.9 Part 3 . For Algorithms How to combine and/or modify an existing algorithm. | . | . Benefits of combining algorithms can reduce development time, testing time, and simplify the identification of errors. | . | . Rules . step/rule 1: start with any positive integer | step/rule 2: if the preceding term is even; divide by 2 | step/rule 3: if the preceding term is odd; multiply by 3 and add 1 | step/rule 4: repeat steps until you arrive at 1 | fact: the sequence should ALWAYS end up at 1 if repeated. | . Algorithm to Start (Determining Whether a Number is Even or Odd) . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) if (varx %2 == 0): print(&quot;the number is even&quot;) else: print(&quot;the number is odd&quot;) # Run this cell to see how it works . choose value for x the number is even . How can we modify this code to match our goal . Hint: uses arithmetic operations | Hint: look at the steps of the equation and try and modify it to fit them | Must display all numbers used in it | . Solution . Step 1 . steps/rules 2 &amp; 3. | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) if (varx %2 == 0): varx == varx/2 # Change print to the function else: varx == varx * 3 + 1 # Change print to the function print(varx) . Step 2 . step/rule 4; here we add the loop | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) while varx != 1: if (varx %2 == 0): varx = varx/2 # Change print to the function else: varx = varx * 3 + 1 # Change print to the function print(varx) . Step 3 . Display all values throughout the algorithm | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) print(varx) while varx != 1: if (varx %2 == 0): varx = varx/2 print(varx) # add Display else: varx = varx * 3 + 1 print(varx) # add Display print(varx) # Final # Should be 1 every time . Takeaways . You can use code you&#39;ve previously wrote in order to make a project easier. | Breaking algorithms down into steps can make things easier and more simple. | . Hacks . create another algorithm using a famous mathematical algorithm such as the &quot;collatz conjecture.&quot; and explain your steps in a post on a blog. | . 3.11 Binary Search . Goals/Objectives: . detirmine number of iterations required to find vlue in data set. | explain requirements for binary search | . What is Binary Search? . Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. | An algorithm for iterating to find a value inside a data set | . About Binary Search: . Binary Search Algorithm starts in the middle of a data set of numbers and eliminates half the data. This process reapeats until the desired value is found or until all elements have been eliminated. | In order to use binary search effectivly and properly, data must be stored in order | COLLEGE BOARD INDEX STARTS AT 1 NOT 0 | . Think about how you would you would try to find a certain number in this set. . One way would be to line up the numbers and count them individually untill you find the desired value. . When working with large data sets with lots of numbers, methods like these wont work . Instead, a Binary Search would be more effective. | . Here we can see the numbers are set in an increasing order. Setting numbers in an increasing or decreasing is needed for a binary search . Binary search is started with the middle number first Middle number is found by taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two | . | Binary Search can be represented using a tree as shown below | . . Heres an easy way to put it: . binary search fidns the desired element by continuously chopping the search area in half | say the element you are looking for is &#39;f&#39; | . [a b c d e f g h] . We would start in the middle at element &#39;d&#39; | becuase our target is greater than d we will eliminate everything left of &#39;d&#39; including &#39;d&#39; (chopping it in half) . [e f g h] is what now remains . again we would &#39;chop in half&#39; | say we iterate through &#39;g&#39; and &#39;h&#39;, our desired element is still not found so we would eliminate &#39;g; and &#39;h&#39; and continue the process | . [e f] . now we are down to 2 elements | &#39;chopping in half&#39; will give us our desired element | . [f] . | . def BinarySearch(array, x, low, high): # Repeat until the pointers low and high meet each other while low &lt;= high: mid = low + (high - low)//2 # find the middle (taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two) if array[mid] == x: # if desired number is the middle is found return desired number (middle number) return mid elif array[mid] &lt; x: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 return -1 array = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] x = 4 result = BinarySearch(array, x, 0, len(array)-1) if result != -1: print(&quot;Element is present at index &quot; + str(result)) else: print(&quot;Not found&quot;) . Element is present at index 1 . We have created a function called binary_search() function which takes two arguments - a list to be sorted and a number to be searched. . | We have declared two variables to store the lowest and highest values in the list. The lowest is assigned initial value to 0, the highest to len(list1) 1 and mid as 0. . | Next, we have declared the while loop with the condition that the lowest is equal and smaller than the highest. The while loop will iterate if the number has not been found yet. . | In the while loop, we find the mid value and compare the index value to the number we are searching for. . | If the value of the mid-index is smaller than n, we increase the mid value by 1 and assign it to the low. The search moves to the left side. . | Otherwise, if the value of mid index is larger than n, we decrease the mid value by 1 and assign it to the high. The search moves to the right side. . | If the n is equal to the mid value then return mid. . | This will happen until the low is equal and smaller than the high. . | If we reach at the end of the function, then the element is not present in the list. We return -1 to the calling function. . | . . Hacks . Using my example above and steps below, create your own iteration using binary search . Steps . Compare x with the middle element. | If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index. | Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half. | Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half. | . import random x = random.seed(10,20) print(x) . None . Homework Assignment (DUE FRIDAY 12/09 BY 5:00 PM) . Consider this situation: .

Coding all of these individually takes a lot of unnecessary time, how can we shorten this time? . Iteration . Iteration: repetition of a process applied to the result or taken from a previous statement. | Many types of iteration | Some are for loops, while loops, and &quot;for loop and range()&quot;, etc. | . Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are iterable . | Able to iterate with the iter() command. . There are 2 types of iteration:definite and indefinite. Definite iteration clarifies how many times the loop is going to run, while indefinite specifies a condition that must be met . | . for variable in iterable: statement() . Iterator? Iterable?

It is usually formatted in the way below because a 2D array is meant to be 2-dimensional: . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Printing a 2D Array . We already know that we can&#39;t just print the matrix by calling it. We need to iterate through it to print it. . def print_matrix1(matrix): for i in range(len(matrix)): # outer for loop. This runs on i which represents the row. range(len(matrix)) is in order to iterate through the length of the matrix for j in range(len(matrix[i])): # inner for loop. This runs on the length of the i&#39;th row in the matrix (j changes for each row with a different length) print(matrix[i][j], end=&quot; &quot;) # [i][j] is the 2D location of that value in the matrix, kinda like a coordinate pair. [i] iterates to the specific row and [j] iterates to the specific value in the row. end=&quot; &quot; changes the end value to space, not a new line. print() # prints extra line. this is in the outer loop, not the inner loop, because it only wants to print a new line for each row . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] print(&quot;Raw matrix (list of lists): &quot;) print(keypad) print(&quot;Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration:&quot;) print_matrix1(keypad) print() . Raw matrix (list of lists): [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&#39; &#39;, 0, &#39; &#39;]] Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] def print_matrix2(matrix): for row in matrix: # Iterates through each &quot;row&quot; of matrix. Row is a dummy variable, it could technically be anything. It iterates through each value of matrix and each value is it&#39;s own list. in this syntax the list is stored in &quot;row&quot;. for col in row: # Iterates through each value in row. Again col, column, is a dummy variable. Each value in row is stored in col. print(col, end=&quot; &quot;) # Same as 1 print() # Same as 1 print_matrix2(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . More Functions . Try to find another way to print the matrix. Only complete one of the two (unless you&#39;d like to do both). Below is a hint . fruit = [&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;bananas&quot;, &quot;grapes&quot;] print(fruit) print(*fruit) # Python built in function: &quot;*&quot;. Figure out what it does . [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;bananas&#39;, &#39;grapes&#39;] apples bananas grapes . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] def print_matrix3(matrix): for i in matrix: print(*i) print_matrix3(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . Alternatively, find a way to print the matrix using the iter() function you already learned. Or use both! . def print_matrix4(matrix): code = &quot;your code goes here&quot; . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] . Print what month you were born and how old you are by iterating through the keyboard (don&#39;t just write a string). . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] def printMonthAge(matrix): j=0 q = matrix[0] w = matrix[1] e = matrix[2] r = matrix[3] t = e[6] + w[6] + r[5] + w[2] y = str(q[1]) + str(q[5]) while j==0: print(&quot;Month born: &quot;, t) print(&quot;Age: &quot;, y) j += 1 printMonthAge(keyboard) . Month born: JUNE Age: 15 . Challenge . Change all of the letters that you DIDN&#39;T print above to spaces, &quot; &quot;, and then print the full keyboard. (the things you did print should remain in the same spot) . Alternative Challenge: If you would prefer, animate it using some form of delay so it flashes one of your letters at a time on the board in order and repeats. (this one may be slightly more intuitive) . DO NOT HARD CODE THIS. Don&#39;t make it harder on yourself, iterate through, make it abstract so it can be used dynamically. You should be able to input any string and your code should work. . Note: This is my work for the code. I don&#39;t think it works because the code is not displaying anything. At this point, I am stuck and I don&#39;t know what to do now. . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] def printMonthAge(matrix): q = matrix[0] w = matrix[1] e = matrix[2] r = matrix[3] p = 0 j = 0 g = 0 f = 0 testV = 0 # for i in matrix: while j &lt; 13: if q[j] != q[1]: q[j] = &quot; &quot; else: testV +=1 j += 1 # p += 1 while g &lt; 12: if w[f] != w[1]: w[f] = &quot; &quot; else: testV +=1 g += 1 # f += 1 while p &lt; 11: if e[p] != e[1]: e[p] = &quot; &quot; else: testV +=1 p += 1 # o += 1 while f &lt; 10: if r[f] != r[1]: r[f] = &quot; &quot; else: testV +=1 f += 1 # a += 1 # print(*i) iter(matrix) printMonthAge(keyboard) . . 1 6 R A H C M .

Participation . -Calculate the total sum of two numbers, if it is equal to 200, print 200, if otherwise, print the sum. . num1 = 100 num2 = 100 sum = num1 + num2 if sum == 200: print(&quot;sum = 200&quot;) else: print(sum) . sum = 200 . Lesson Overview - 3.7 Nested Conditionals . Nested conditional statements are if else statements inside more if else statements | . Analyzing Code Walkthrough . Psuedocode to the left, block code to the right | Approach the problem by going through each condition one at a time . Decide which ones are false to skip and which ones are true to execute | . | You Try: . | . score = 82 if (score &gt;=90) { console.log(&quot;You got an A, congrats!&quot;); } else { if (score &gt;= 75) { console.log(&quot;Please come to retake up to a 90 next week at tutorial!&quot;); } else { console.log(&quot;You have detention!&quot;); } } . protein = 25 carbs = 36 sugar = 11 if (carbs &gt;= 55 || protein &lt;= 20 || sugar &gt;= 15) { console.log(&quot;Your lunch is too unhealthy, please pick a new one&quot;) } else { if (carbs &lt; 35 || protein &lt; 25) { console.log (&quot;This lunch is alright but try to add some more carbs or protein&quot;) } else { if (sugar &gt;= 11) { console.log (&quot;Looks great but lets see if we can cut down on sugar, we don&#39;t want diabetes!&quot;) } else { console.log (&quot;Amazing, you created a healthy lunch!!!&quot;) } } } . Writing Nested Code Activity . Write a program that fits these conditions using nested conditionals: If a person has at least 8 hours, they are experienced | If a person is experienced their salary is 90k, if they have ten hours or above their salary 150k | If a person is inexperienced their salary is always 50k | print the salary of the person at the end and whether they are experienced or not | . | Hacks Assignments: . Conditionals: . Write a program that fits these conditions using nested conditionals: If the product is expired, print &quot;this product is no good&quot; | If the cost is above 50 dollars, and the product isn&#39;t expired, print &quot;this product is too expensive&quot; | If the cost is 25 dollars but under 50, and the product isn&#39;t expired, print &quot;this is a regular product&quot; | If the cost is under 25 dollars, print &quot;this is a cheap product&quot; | . | . experience = 10 salary = 0 if experience&gt;=8: print(&quot;experienced&quot;) salary = 90000 if experience&gt;=10: salary = 150000 print(&quot;Salary: &quot;, salary) else: print(&quot;not experienced&quot;) salary = 50000 print(&quot;Salary: &quot;, salary) . experienced Salary: 150000 . status = &quot;not expired&quot; cost = 28 if status == &quot;not expired&quot;: if cost&gt;=50: print(&quot;This product is too expensive&quot;) elif cost&gt;25 &amp; cost&lt;50: print(&quot;This is a regular product&quot;) elif cost&lt;=25: print(&quot;This is a cheap product&quot;) elif status == &quot;expired&quot;: print(&quot;This product is no good&quot;) .

However, you can lead from any position. | Don’t think that you are incapable of running a leadership position. | Keep the end result in mind | Don’t blindly follow something, be curious and question what you do | You can learn more stuff from going to a teacher’s classroom in office hours | Building skills with technical feats along with making friends is a way to success | Stanford’s computer science program helps build skills for success | When you get an opportunity, take it and do something about it, don’t dismiss it | Your value is your perspective, not just how much you know about coding | Your perspective provides the most value for the team | Interview should be more of a conversation | You will fail more than you succeed, the more you fail, the more you will learn which is better than succeeding all the time | . Paragraph . I learned that I should become more future-focused and don’t be afraid to try new things. I should focus more on the end goal, and think about what I can achieve with it. I should keep persisting and not be afraid to fail, since failing only makes me wiser and increases my chance of success. In the presentation, one of the tenants mentioned how it’s important to take opportunities. The speaker was afraid of taking a leadership position, but she was encouraged to, and ended up becoming successful. Therefore, I should also take advantage of opportunities later on when they come. Computer science is also not just all about coding, it’s more about my perspective in the team. So, while I should be learning more about coding, I should also be aware of my opinions and what I feel is good for the team. Stanford’s computer science program is especially good at helping to develop important life skills for the future. I learned also to think more critically about my actions and future, so then I can be aware of what I am doing and not blindly follow a path. .",

            "content": "Python, RapidAPI Terms . APIs and tooling like Jupyter docs allows many opportunities in fields like Data Science. As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. &quot;&quot;&quot; import requests url = &quot;https://cost-of-living-and-prices.p.rapidapi.com/cities&quot; headers = { &quot;X-RapidAPI-Key&quot;: &quot;hi&quot;, &quot;X-RapidAPI-Host&quot;: &quot;hi&quot; } response = requests.request(&quot;GET&quot;, url, headers=headers) print(response.text) # # This code looks for &quot;house types&quot; # print(&quot;House Type: &quot;) # names = response.json().get(&#39;homeType&#39;) # turn response to json() so we can extract &quot;homeType&quot; # for key in names.items(): # this finds key, value pairs in country # print(key) # # print() # This code looks for San Diego result = response.json().get(&#39;cities&#39;) for re in result: if re[&quot;city_name&quot;] == &quot;San Diego&quot;: for key, value in re.items(): print(key, value) # print(&quot;Condos: &quot;) # condos = response.json().get(&#39;homeType&#39;) # for condo in condos: # if condo[&quot;homeType&quot;] == &quot;CONDO&quot;: # for key, value in condo.items(): # print(key, value) . Digital Coin Example . This example provides digital coin feedback (ie Bitcoin). It include popularity, price, symbols, etc. . A valid X-RapidAPI-Key is required. Look in code for link to RapidAPI page | Read all comments in code for further guidance | . # RapidAPI page https://rapidapi.com/Coinranking/api/coinranking1/ # Begin Rapid API Code import requests url = &quot;https://coinranking1.p.rapidapi.com/coins&quot; querystring = {&quot;referenceCurrencyUuid&quot;:&quot;yhjMzLPhuIDl&quot;,&quot;timePeriod&quot;:&quot;24h&quot;,&quot;tiers[0]&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;orderBy&quot;:&quot;marketCap&quot;,&quot;orderDirection&quot;:&quot;desc&quot;,&quot;limit&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:&quot;0&quot;} headers = { &quot;X-RapidAPI-Key&quot;: &quot;jcmbea0fa2ff5msh7f14bf69be38ca6p175482jsn6c4988114560&quot;, # place your key here &quot;X-RapidAPI-Host&quot;: &quot;coinranking1.p.rapidapi.com&quot; } response = requests.request(&quot;GET&quot;, url, headers=headers, params=querystring) print(response.text) # End Rapid API Code json = response.json() # convert response to python json object # Observe data from an API.

Formatting Digital Coin example . JSON text transferred from the API in the previous cell was converted to a Python Dictionary called json. The &quot;coins&quot; in the dictionary contain a list of the most relevant data. Look at the code and comments to see how the original text is turned into something understandable. Additionally, there are error check to make sure we are starting the code with the expectation that the API was run correctly. . &quot;&quot;&quot; This cell is dependent on valid run of API above. - try and except code is making sure &quot;json&quot; was properly run above - inside second try is code that is used to process Coin API data Note. Run this cell repeatedly to format data without re-activating API &quot;&quot;&quot; try: print(&quot;JSON data is Python type: &quot; + str(type(json))) try: # Extracting Coins JSON status, if the API worked status = json.get(&#39;status&#39;) print(&quot;API status: &quot; + status) print() # Extracting Coins JSON data, data about the coins data = json.get(&#39;data&#39;) # Procedural abstraction of Print code for coins def print_coin(c): print(c[&quot;symbol&quot;], c[&quot;price&quot;]) print(&quot;Icon Url: &quot; + c[&quot;iconUrl&quot;]) print(&quot;Rank Url: &quot; + c[&quot;coinrankingUrl&quot;]) # Coins data was observed to be a list for coin in data[&#39;coins&#39;]: print_coin(coin) print() except: print(&quot;Did you insert a valid key in X-RapidAPI-Key of API cell above?&quot;) print(json) except: print(&quot;This cell is dependent on running API call in cell above!&quot;) .

Our plan is to create a managing and planning system using data from Canvas. We will try to use Canvas’s API(It is public and we are allowed to use it) to recieve information on peoples’ assignments, events, etc. Our purpose of creating this is to help make students’ planners easy to make, as well as helping them to be more organized while also saving time by using an automated system to help do the planning for them. . Row 1: Program Purpose and Function . Our program’s purpose is to provide an automated organizer for students’ tasks. The function is to utilize a calendar and allow students to add, remove, and edit events on each day. Students will also be able to sign in with their own account in order to save their events. . Row 2: Data Abstraction . The data will be a list which includes a students’ events. As a student adds, removes, or edits an event, the list will change. The name of the variable representing the list will be calendarEvent, or some variable related to events on a calendar. . Row 3: Managing Complexity . We can manage the complexity by creating a new list specific to each user. Then, we can create a list of all the users, making the entire project easy to manage. . Row 4: Procedural Abstraction . My student-developed procedure is to make the login screen for the website. I will also help to log all of the information entered by the users when they first use the scheduler. . Row 5: Algorithm Implementation . While we have not started on the project yet, our plan is to make a list inside of a list, etc. The list can be appended by using a while loop. . Row 6: Testing . After making slight changes, I will test the code by using a local server. I will do it very often in order to make sure that everything is working before I move onto a new task. .",

            "content": "Blog Reflections . Me and my partner, Noor, have decided on making a math quiz on applab for the week 4 requirement. We plan on using basic math questions to test out applabs developer tool. We will use the given code blocks and experiment around to find the proper layout for the quiz we want. We plan on them that they are guaranteed a 0% on their next math test. It is what it is. We will also add a rickroll at the end of the quiz. Some struggles that we faced were how to record the score for the quiz. It took us a while, but we managed to add the score to the quiz. I also originally wanted to add an error screen when you got a question wrong, but it did not work out very well, so we just added a sound effect instead. One way that I worked with data is to store a variable for the score of the quiz. The base score is 3, and each incorrect selection subtracts a point. The quiz code was also placed in chronological order, going from clicking functions for the title screen to the end of the quiz. This is because java runs from top to bottom, so coding from the bottom to the top would possibly lead to errors. . It was challenging to put all those semicolons at the end of every line. The commands were also slightly different from python, preventing the code from being very straightforward. . Some ideas for the college board create task is to make an AI quiz, which can start to learn your own learning preferences. . .",

            "content": "Insights and Takeaways from the Panel . I learned that computer science is perfect for those who like problem solving. I am personally okay with it, so I’m pretty sure computer science is good for me. I also learned that having logical thinking is crucial for engineering majors, and this is especially true when you have to code in these majors, since coding requires step-by-step logic. Computer science is very important to use in real world situations, since it is used everywhere as the world relies more on the internet. Therefore, if one wants to make an impact, then they should learn computer science well. When it comes to learning CSP at DNHS, I learned that I should use Google more often when researching for the correct syntax. This way, it is much more efficient, and I don’t have to be asking others online and waiting forever for a reponse. It’s also best not to cut corners and not just do things for points. By doing things just for a grade, it takes away the purpose of learning, which isn’t really good in the long run. I also shouldn’t give up when running into problems with the code. While I do think that I have done a pretty good job in this area, I believe that I can still improve by changing my mindset so I don’t always get so frustrated when running into a problem. One of the biggest challenges is getting started with computer science, which I believe a lot after going through the first few weeks of school. However, I believe that I should keep pushing and not give up. The takeaway that I believe is the most important is to not compare yourselves to others. Del Norte is a very competitive school, therefore, there’s a lot of pressure to keep up with other people. But, by doing so, it only wastes your time from doing things that you are passionate about, and puts a lot of unnecessary stress on yourself. As a result, the main takeaway is that I should focus on what I like to do, and once I do it well, then I will be able to stand out from others in a unique way. .",

Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The video clearly shows its functionality, inputs, and outputs, and the purpose is valid. The functionality of the code was also written well. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 1 | A function is stated instead of a list. The second code segment also looks oddly similar to a for loop in the first code segment, which is very suspicious that they might’ve been copying and pasting code but switching variables for no apparent reason. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The list seems to manage complexity, and the explanation clearly explains the result of not having the list mentioned. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The two code segments successfully show a procedure and it being called. Its description is adequate but is also slightly vague. However, I don’t think a point would be lost because it isn’t too vague. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Many if statements are used, showing a lot of sequencing, selection, and iteration. The steps of the algorithm are explained in a lot of detail. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The testing has valid calls, conditions, and results. | . Submission 3: . Reporting Category Student Grading Score Collegeboard’s Score Comments . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The purpose is well stated and program functionality, input, and output are clearly shown in both the video and the written description. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The list is applied to the program’s purpose, but the first code segment does not really show the list with data being stored into it. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 0 | The list was shown to manage complexity by making the code more efficient. The result of not using the list is also clearly explained. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | A procedure is shown in the first code segment but it is missing parameters. A different function is called in the second code segment. | . Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | Lots of if and else if statements were used, showing lots of sequencing, selection, and iteration. However, the steps for making the algorithm is too vague. | . Testing | 1 | 0 | All the calls, conditions, and results are clearly stated and the calls are not outputs. | . Submission 4: . Reporting Category Student Grading Score Collegeboard’s Score Comments . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The video demonstrated input, functionality, and output, the purpose was clear, and the inputs and outputs were stated in great detail. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The list has been shown by how data has been stored in it, and is shown fullfilling the program’s purpose of catching fish. The written description of the list is also clear and concise. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | List is shown to manage complexity in the code segment and is well described. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 1 | The procedure is shown and is called, but the parameters are very weird and I’m not sure if that’s the proper way to use parameters. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | For loops and if statements are used, demonstrating sequencing, selection, and iteration. The described steps are also detailed enough to be able to know every part of the procedure. | . Testing | 1 | 0 | The two calls use different arguments and use the procedure in 3c. The conditions and results are explained in adequate detail. | . Reflection: . As a final summary, by combining all the CPT scorings I’ve done, the most important lesson would be that I do not have to be extremely detailed when answering some questions. This is because I am a very detail-oriented person, and I always try to make things as detailed as possible. However, based on the CPT scorings, I’ve noticed patterns where you do not have to be extremely detailed(such as in identifying the purpose or list as well as describing the functionality). But, there are some parts where great detail is necessary, such as when explaining the steps of an algorithm and describing the identified procedure. Based on the scorings for just the CPT scoring part 3, I’ve noticed that lists and procedures can have data stored in it and have it called in many creative ways. For example, submission 1 did not just outright show a list being created. Instead, it had data stored inside of a procedure, which demonstrates creativity and innovation. I also learned that the testing should refer specifically to the code and not just on what the user sees when using the program. In addition, the arguments should have specific values and the conditions should be related to the parameter or arguments. If no value is given to the parameters, it is likely that a person will be stating the functionality of the code rather than an actual tested value. .",

Reflection: . For most of the time, I gave a point while Collegeboard did not give one. This was because I did not read their descriptions in great detail. I was only looking for key words in their descriptions. This means that I should be more detailed next time to find any problems with the submission’s descriptions. Overall, I think that my program should be very detailed in order to ensure that I get the maximum possible points. The submissions that got low scores had very vague descriptions, while the submissions that got high scores had very detailed descriptions. For the last submission, the testing part failed to meet the standard because it tested for one thing and gave two possible outputs. However, these are outputs and are not two different calls to the function. .",

For Submission 1, Collegeboard did not give the point for Program Pupose and Function because the purpose was not valid. However, I did award a point thinking that the purpose was good enough. This means that when I submit my project to Collegeboard, I should go deeper in the purpose and not just specify the overall function of the program(While also keeping it concise to about 1 sentence). For Submission 2, I did not give a point for Data Abstraction because I thought that you needed to take a screenshot of the variable of the list for the code segment. However, Collegeboard did give the point for Data Abstraction because the code segments did show the use of the lists. While the list wasn’t directly stated in the code segment, the code segment still shows the utilization of the lists which makes this category valid for a point. Also, the names of the lists were specified in 3.b.iii so the grader knows which variables are lists in the code. Therefore, a point for Data Abstraction was awarded. This tells to me that I should show the utilization of a list in the code segments rather than just showing the creation of the variable of the list. Overall, through grading these submissions, I realized that for much of 3a I do not have to write up a whole paragraph for each subsection. I am now aware that I should be more detailed in the code segments and on explaining the code when I will be making my project. .",
