Switch their order so that the first value is smaller than the second value. Move on to values with index of 2 and 3. Compare again. Keep doing this until you reach the end, and restart the entire process until the list is sorted from least to greatest.- Selection sort: It reads the list and swaps the lowest value into the first index. It then finds the next lowest and swaps it with the number that is in the second index. This keeps happening until the list is fully sorted. | . [88, 39, 53, 39, 58, 43, 74, 81, 71, 51] . How would you sort this list with... . Merge Sort | Insertion SortExplain. . | Merge sort: Find the middle of the list and split it into two separate lists. Then, get these two lists and split both of them into equal halves, leading to 4 separate lists that are roughly equal in size. Keep doing this until the entire list is split into individual elements. Then, you compare each element and recombine them by comparing each element&#39;s value and sorting it from greatest to least. Keep doing this until your entire list is formed, and you will have a sorted list.- Insertion sort: It is similar to bubble swap, except when two values are switched the algorithm goes back a step and continues to rearrange the element until it is in the correct place. After that, it moves onto the region of the list that isn&#39;t sorted and continues to do the same process again of comparing two values and moving back if two elements are swapped. | .

Jupyter Notebooks is a convenient way to learn the language without the overhead of creating a full Website. Jupyter Notebooks had ChatGPT plugins to assist with design and troubleshooting problems. This Notebook has colors on HTML pages that were designed with a dark mode background. . JavaScript / Jupyter General References .

Multiple cells are used to setup HTML in this lesson. Many of the JavaScript cells will use the output tag(s) to write into the HTML that has been setup. . %%html is used to setup HTML code block | &quot;style&quot; tag enables visuals customization | &quot;div&quot; tag is setup to receive data | . %%html &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;style&gt; #output { background-color: #353b45; padding: 10px; border: 3px solid #ccc; } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;output&quot;&gt; Hello! &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; . . Hello! . output explored . There are several ways to ouput the classic introduction message: &quot;Hello, World!&quot; . Before you go further, open Console on your Browser. JavaScript developer leaves Console open all the time!!! | The function console.log() outputs to Console, this is often used for inspection or debugging. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. Developer call this a hard coded string. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; literal is a parameter to console.log(), element.txt() and alert(). | The element.txt function is part of Jupyter Notebook %%js magic. This is convenient for Notebook and testing. | The alert command outputs the parameter to a dialog box, so you can see it in this Jupyter notebook. The alert commands are shown, but are commented out as the stop run all execution of the notebook. | Note, in a Web Application Debugging: An alert is often used for less savy Developers. Console is used by more savy developers; console often requires setting up a lot of outputs. Source level debugging is the most powerful solution for debugging and does not require alert or console commands. | . %%js // required to allow cell to be JavaScript enabled console.log(&quot;JavaScript/Jupyter Output Intro&quot;); // Browser Console output; debugging or tracing console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); console.log(&quot;Hello, World Again!&quot;); // Document Object Model (DOM) output; output to HTML, CSS which is standard for a Web Page // &lt;mark&gt;select element method&lt;/mark&gt;: DOM native JavaScript get, document.getElementByID document.getElementById(&quot;output&quot;).textContent = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; // &lt;mark&gt;jQuery CSS-style method&lt;/mark&gt;: Tag for DOM selector, $(&#39;#output&#39;) $(&#39;#output&#39;).append(&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hello World Again!&#39;); // br is break or new line, b is bold // Jupyter built in magic element for testing and convenience of development element.text(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); // element is output option as part of %%js magic element.append(&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hello World Again!&#39;); //alert(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); . multiple outputs using one variable . This second example is a new sequence of code, two or more lines of code forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, thank goodness!!! In the previous example we were typing the string &quot;Hello, World&quot; over and over. Observe with the variable msg=&quot;Hello, World!&quot;; we type the string once and now use msg over and over. . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console, be sure to Inspect it! | The element.text() is part of Jupyter Notebooks and displays as output blow the code on this page. Until we build up some more interesting data for Web Site, we will not use be using the Python HTML, CSS technique. | The alert(msg) works the same as previous, but as the other commands uses msg as parameter. | . %%js console.log(&quot;Variable Definition&quot;); var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; // Use msg to output code to Console and Jupyter Notebook console.log(msg); //right click browser select Inspect, then select Console to view element.text(msg); //alert(msg); . output showing use of a function . This example passes the defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are multiple steps in this code.. The &quot;definition of the function&quot;: &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. Passing a parameter is required when you call this function. | The &quot;call to the function:&quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually runs the function. The variable &quot;msg&quot; is used a parameter when calling the logIt function. | . | Showing reuse of function... There are two calls to the logIt function | This is called Prodedural Abstraction, a term that means reusing the same code | . | . %%js console.log(&quot;Function Definition&quot;); /* Function: logIt * Parameter: output * Description: The parameter is &quot;output&quot; to console and jupyter page */ function logIt(output) { console.log(output); element.append(output + &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); //alert(output); } // First sequence calling logIt function var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; logIt(msg); // Second sequence calling logIt function var msg = &quot;Hello, &lt;b&gt;Students&lt;/b&gt;!&quot; // replaces content of variable var classOf = &quot;Welcome CS class of 2023-2024.&quot; logIt(msg + &quot; &quot; + classOf); // concatenation of strings . output showing Loosely typed data . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. . To define a variable you prefix the name with var or const. The variable type is determined by JavaScript at runtime. | Python and many interpretive languages are loosely typed like JavaScript. This is considered programmer friendly. | Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see terms like String, Integer, Double, and Object in the source code. | In JavaScript, the typeof keyword returns the type of the variable. Become familiar with type as it is valuable in conversation and knowing type help you understand how to modify data. Each variable type will have built in methods to manage content within the data type. | . %%js console.log(&quot;Examine Data Types&quot;); // Function to add typeof to output function getType(output) { return typeof output + &quot;: &quot; + output; } // Function defintion function logIt(output) { console.log(getType(output)); // logs string console.info(output); // logs object element.append(getType(output) + &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); // adds to Jupyter output //alert(getType(output)); } // Common Types element.append(&quot;Common Types &lt;br&gt;&quot;); logIt(&quot;Mr M&quot;); // String logIt(1997); // Number logIt(true); // Boolean element.append(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); // Object Type, this definition is often called a array or list element.append(&quot;Object Type, array &lt;br&gt;&quot;); var scores = [ 90, 80, 100 ]; logIt(scores); element.append(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;); // Complex Object, this definition is often called hash, map, hashmap, or dictionary element.append(&quot;Object Type, hash or dictionary &lt;br&gt;&quot;); var person = { // key:value pairs seperated by comma &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;role&quot;: &quot;Teacher&quot; }; logIt(person); logIt(JSON.stringify(person)); //method used to convert this object into readable format . Build a Person object and JSON . JavaScript and other languages have special properties and syntax to store and represent data. In fact, a class in JavaScript is a special function. . Definition of class allows for a collection of data, the &quot;class Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of a Person. | Instance of a class, the &quot;const teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; makes an object &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;class Person&quot;. | Setting and Getting properties After creating teacher and student objects, observe that properties can be changed/muted or extracted/accessed. | . %%html &lt;!-- load jQuery and tablesorter scripts --&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;!-- load jQuery and tablesorter scripts --&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.tablesorter/2.31.3/js/jquery.tablesorter.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;style&gt; /* CSS-style selector maps to table id or other id&#39;s in HTML */ #jsonTable, #flaskTable { background-color: #353b45; padding: 10px; border: 3px solid #ccc; box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em grey; } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- Table for writing and extracting jsonText --&gt; &lt;table id=&quot;jsonTable&quot;&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Classroom JSON Data&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td id=&quot;jsonText&quot;&gt;{&quot;classroom&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;object&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;sample&quot;,&quot;ghID&quot;:&quot;sample&quot;,&quot;classOf&quot;:2000,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;sample&quot;}]}&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; . .

            "title": "Big Idea 2 - Data Related to User Guide",
            "content": "Introduction . When building an application that requires users to create accounts or sign in, handling data related to users is crucial. This data can include things like user profiles, preferences, and activity logs, which can be used to personalize the user experience and improve the application&#39;s performance. . By learning how to handle data related to users effectively and efficiently, you&#39;ll be equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to build helpful applications that meet the needs of your users. . PLEASE DON&#39;T OPEN THE POPCORN HACKS, WE WILL OPEN THEM DURING THE PRESENTATION . Basics of Class and User Data . Establishing Class/User Data and making a new user . Because Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, everything in it represents an object. Lists, dictionaries, functions, etc. are all examples of Python objects. Generally speaking, a Python object is an entity of data items and methods describing the behavior of those items. . A Python class is a template used to create Python objects. We can think of it as a cooking recipe, where all the ingredients and their quantities are listed, and the whole process of cooking is described step-by-step. . In this case, we can compare a cake recipe to a class, and a cake cooked following that recipe to an object (i.e., an instance of that class). Using the same recipe (class), we can create many cakes (objects). This is the essence of creating a class in Python: to define data elements and the rules establishing how these elements can interact and change their state — and then use this framework to build various objects in a set way, instead of creating them from scratch every time. . Let&#39;s look at a few examples: . class Bikes: name = &quot;&quot; gear = 0 # create objects of class bike1 = Bikes() # objectName = ClassName() bike2 = Bikes() . Now that we have our class and object defined, we can now run code to modify certain attributes of our objects. . bike1.gear = 11 bike1.name = &quot;Mountain Bike&quot; bike2.gear = 13 bike2.name = &quot;Road Bike&quot; print(f&quot;Name: {bike1.name}, Gears: {bike1.gear} &quot;) . Name: Mountain Bike, Gears: 11 . Popcorn Hacks #1: Add another print command to display the attributes of Bike #2. What output will this code segment produce? print(f&quot;Name: {bike2.name}, Gears: {bike2.gear}&quot;) . Name: Road Bike, Gears: 13 . Example: Defining a User Class . Now we will look into Classes for users of a program or website. . class User: def __init__(self, username, email): self.username = username self.email = email def display_info(self): print(f&quot;Username: {self.username}, Email: {self.email}&quot;) . For this cell, we define a User class with a constructor method &quot;init&quot; that takes username and email as parameters. The display_info method is used to print the user information. . For backend functionality, this class can be used to create, manipulate, and manage user data. For example, when a new user signs up for an account, you could create a new User object with their username and email. This object can then be used to perform various operations, such as validating the user&#39;s input, storing the user&#39;s data in a database, or processing user-related requests. . Now let&#39;s make a new User: . new_user = User(&quot;jeffrey&quot;, &quot;leejeffreysc@gmail.com&quot;) new_user.display_info() . Username: jeffrey, Email: leejeffreysc@gmail.com . Here&#39;s a step-by-step breakdown of how the code relates to backend functionality: . new_user = User(&quot;jeffrey&quot;, &quot;leejeffreysc@gmail.com&quot;): This line creates a new User object, initializing it with the username &quot;jeffrey&quot; and the email &quot;leejeffreysc@gmail.com&quot;. This could represent a user who has just signed up for an account, and the input values would typically come from user input, such as a frontend signup form. . new_user.display_info(): This line calls the display_info method on the new_user object, which prints the user&#39;s information (username and email) to the console. In a real-world backend application, you might use this method or a similar one to display user information in logs, send a welcome email, or create an API response with the user&#39;s data. . User/Class @ Decorators: . A Python Class allows for the use of @ decorators, these allow access to attribute data without the use of functions. . @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to &quot;GET&quot; attribute data in a clean method (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to &quot;UPDATE&quot;/set attribute data in a clean method (object.name = &quot;Jeffrey&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;Jeffrey&quot;)) | . The getter and setter methods provide a clean and controlled way to access and modify the attributes of an object. This can be particularly useful when interacting with databases, APIs, or other parts of a web application that require the management and manipulation of object attributes. . class Student: def __init__(self, student, name): self._student = student self._name = name @property def name(self): return self._name @name.setter def name(self, new_name): self._name = new_name . In this example, the Student class has a name attribute, which is accessed and modified through the name property getter and setter methods. The _name attribute uses an underscore prefix, which is a convention to indicate it should not be accessed directly. . Usage of the getter and setter methods are below: . student = Student(1001, &quot;Derek Sol&quot;) print(student.name) # Get the name using the getter method student.name = &quot;Jagger Klein&quot; # Set the name using the setter method print(student.name) . Derek Sol Jagger Klein . Popcorn Hacks #2: The following code segment for computers does not have getter and setter methods called. Using the missing attributes &quot;model&quot; and &quot;year&quot;, add example getter and setters methods for this class. Show us an example output that this code segment might produce. class Computer: def __init__(self, model, year): self._model = model self._year = year @property def model(self): return self._model @model.setter def model(self, new_model): self._model = new_model @property def year(self): return self._year @year.setter def year(self, new_year): self._year = new_year computer = Computer(&quot;HP&quot;, 2020) print(&quot;Model: &quot;, computer.model) print(&quot;Year: &quot;, computer.year) computer.model = &quot;HP Pavilion&quot; print(computer.model) . Model: HP Year: 2020 HP Pavilion . Databases and SQLite . A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, manipulation, and management of that data. In other words, a database is a software application that allows you to store and manage large amounts of data in an organized manner. . Some Examples of Databases: . Storing and managing customer data, such as contact information, order history, and customer preferences. | Keeping track of inventory levels and stock movements in a warehouse or retail store. | Managing financial transactions, such as payments, invoices, and receipts. | . SQLite is a software library that provides a user-friendly database management system. Unlike other databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, SQLite is programmed within an application, which means it does not require a separate server process to operate. This makes SQLite great for web applications or for use in situations where you don&#39;t need a full database server. . In this lesson, we will be demonstrating how to set up a SQLite database in Flask, a Python web framework. Flask allows programmers to easily interact with SQLite databases, and we&#39;ll walk through the process of setting up a new database, creating tables, and adding data. We&#39;ll also cover some basic SQL commands that you can use to interact with your database, including CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. . Setting up a SQLite database in Flask . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 # Create a Flask application app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;database.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database using SQL commands cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE students (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, grade INTEGER)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . Note: This will create a new file &#39;database.db&#39; in the _notebooks folder if one doesn&#39;t exist. . Breaking down this code segment: . We imported the necessary libraries and tools | We created a Flask application | We connected to the SQLite database using SQLite3 | We created a cursor object to execute SQL commands | We created tables in the database using SQL commands | . Flask provides several extensions and tools for working with SQLite databases, including Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-SQLite3, and Flask-Admin. These tools provide a high-level interface for interacting with the database, making it easy to perform common operations such as adding, updating, and deleting records. . CRUD Commands with SQLite . CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the basic operations you can perform on data. SQL is useful library because it allows programmers to create new tables to organize data, add new data to a table, update data that&#39;s already there, or delete data that&#39;s no longer needed. . C: To create a new record in a database, you must first define the table structure that will store the data. This can be accomplished using SQL commands such as CREATE. Once the table is created, data can be added to it using the INSERT INTO command. . | R: To retrieve data from the database, you can use the READ command. You can specify which fields you want to retrieve and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. There are also several functions available to aggregate and manipulate data. . | U: To modify existing data in the database, you can use the UPDATE command. You will need to specify which table and fields you want to update, and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. . | D: To remove data from the database, you can use the DELETE command. . | . Example of CRUD within an SQLite Database . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 # Create a Flask application app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;database.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database using SQL commands cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE basketball (_player TEXT PRIMARY KEY, _team TEXT, _position TEXT, _opinion TEXT)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . Hypothetically, our programmer wanted to create an application about basketball players, and created a new table in SQL to store and interact with user-submitted data. Using the same method as the previous table, a new table &#39;basketball&#39; is created by the cursor and added to the &#39;database.db&#39; file. . Create Function: . def create(): database = &#39;database.db&#39; player = input(&quot;Enter the player name&quot;) team = input(&quot;Enter team name&quot;) position = input(&quot;Enter player position&quot;) opinion = input(&quot;Enter your opinion &quot;) # Connecting to the database, create cursor to execute the SQL command connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Execute SQL to insert record in to db cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO basketball (_player, _team, _position, _opinion) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (player, team, position, opinion)) # Commit the changes connection.commit() print(f&quot;New basketball with {player} is added.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while inserting record&quot;, error) # Closing cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() create() . New basketball with Bob is added. . The create() feature allows users to input information about a basketball player and store it in a SQLite table &#39;basketball&#39; inside the database file we already created &#39;database.db&#39;. The code prompts the user for the player&#39;s name, team name, position, and their opinion about the player, then establishes a connection to the SQLite database and creates a cursor object for executing SQL commands. . The cursor.execute() method is called with an SQL INSERT command to insert a new entry into the &#39;basketball&#39; table. The connection.commit() method saves the changes to the database, and if the record is inserted successfully, a confirmation message is printed. In case of errors, the except block catches the sqlite3.Error exception and prints an error message. Finally, the cursor and the connection to the database are closed, and the create() function is called to execute the code. . Read Function: . def read(): database = &#39;database.db&#39; # Connecting to the database, create cursor to execute the SQL command connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() # Fetch all the records from basketball table results = cursor.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM basketball&#39;).fetchall() if len(results) != 0: for row in results: print(row) else: print(&quot;No player found.&quot;) # Closing cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() read() . (&#39;Bob&#39;, &#39;Clippers&#39;, &#39;defense&#39;, &#39;very good&#39;) . The read() feature retrieves and prints all entries from the &#39;basketball&#39; table in the specified SQLite database. The script establishes a connection to the SQLite database, creates a cursor object for executing SQL commands, and calls the cursor.execute() method with an SQL SELECT command to fetch all the entires from the &#39;basketball&#39; table. The fetchall() method retrieves all the rows returned by the SELECT command and stores them in the results variable. . The code then checks if there are any records in the table and, if so, iterates through each row in the results using a &#39;for loop&#39; and prints the row. If there are no records, the program prints &quot;No player found&quot;. Finally, the cursor and the connection to the database are closed, and the read() function is called to execute the code. . Update Function: . import sqlite3 def update(): database = &#39;database.db&#39; player = input(&quot;Enter a basketball player to update the opinion for:&quot;) opinion = input(&quot;Enter new opinion:&quot;) # Connecting to the database, create cursor to execute the SQL command connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Updating review for the basketball cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE basketball SET _opinion = ? WHERE _player = ?&quot;, (opinion, player)) if cursor.rowcount != 0: print(f&quot;Review for the basketball is updated to {opinion}&quot;) connection.commit() else: print(f&quot;Player not found.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error occurred&quot;, error) # Closing cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() update() . Review for the basketball is updated to he is now very trash :( . This update feature updates the opinion for a specific basketball player in an SQLite database. The code defines an update() function, which prompts the user to input the basketball player they want to update and the new opinion for that player. The script connects to the SQLite database, creates a cursor object, and handles any potential errors while executing the SQL command. The cursor.execute() method updates the review in the database for the specified basketball item. . If at least one value is changed, a success message is printed and the changes are committed to the database. Otherwise, a &quot;Player not found.&quot; message is displayed. In the except block, if an error occurs, an error message along with specific error details is printed. Finally, the cursor and connection to the database are closed, and the update() function is called to execute the review update process. . Delete Function . import sqlite3 def delete(): database = &#39;database.db&#39; player = input(&quot;Enter basketball player to delete&quot;) # Connecting to the database, create cursor to execute the SQL command connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM basketball WHERE _player = ?&quot;, (player,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: print(f&quot;{player} does not exist&quot;) else: print(f&quot;Successfully deleted basketball player {player}&quot;) connection.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error occurred: &quot;, error) # Closing cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() delete() . Successfully deleted basketball player Bob . The delete feature deletes a specific basketball player from the specified SQLite database. The code defines a delete() function that prompts the user to input the basketball player they want to delete. After connecting to the SQLite database and creating a cursor object, the code handles potential errors while executing the SQL command. The cursor.execute() method is used to delete the basketball item with the specified ID. . If no rows are affected, a message is printed indicating that the basketball player does not exist. Otherwise, a success message is displayed, confirming the basketball player&#39;s deletion. The changes are then committed to the database. In the except block, any error that occurs triggers an error message along with specific error details. Finally, the cursor and connection to the database are closed, and the delete() function is called to execute the basketball item deletion process. This code showcases a practical way to remove information from an SQLite database based on user input. . Menu Functions: . Alongside the four CRUD functions, a menu function is designed to manage Create, Read, Update, Delete operations and display the schema. The menu function is responsible for taking in user inputs and making the program call various functions. When running a menu function, users enter their desired operation, whether it be Create, Read, Update, or Delete, and the input is checked by various conditions to determine which function should be called. Many menu functions are called recursively, so the cell will repeat the menu process until the user decides to exit. . Popcorn Hacks #3: The menu function below is missing some of the CRUD functions for the specified basketball players table. Fix the following code by adding the intended CRUD functions, then perform a READ function on the database. def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() if operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() if operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() if operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . (&#39;Bob&#39;, &#39;Clippers&#39;, &#39;defense&#39;, &#39;he is now very trash :(&#39;) Please enter c, r, u, or d (&#39;Bob&#39;, &#39;Clippers&#39;, &#39;defense&#39;, &#39;he is now very trash :(&#39;) Please enter c, r, u, or d . Image Uploading with SQLite . Using various Python Libraries, we are able to upload and customize images using python code, as well as using images to interact with databases. . One way to store images in a database is to INSERT the image data as a binary blob. . To store an image as a blob in SQLite, you can first read the image file and convert it to a binary format using a programming language like Python. Here&#39;s an example of how to do this: . Making the Table to store our Image Data: . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 # Create a Flask application app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;hacksIMGdatabase.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database using SQL commands cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE images (name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, data BLOB)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . We use a new data type &quot;BLOB&quot; to store specific data from our .jpg image. . Adding Image Data to our Table: . You can use this example sunset jpg for our code. Download and place it in the same repository as this notebook. Rename image to &#39;image.jpg&#39; . https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/01/04/78/75/360_F_104787586_63vz1PkylLEfSfZ08dqTnqJqlqdq0eXx.jpg . import sqlite3 # Open a connection to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;hacksIMGdatabase.db&#39;) # Read the image file as binary data with open(&#39;images/image.jpg&#39;, &#39;rb&#39;) as jpg: image_data = jpg.read() # Insert the image data into the database conn.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO images (name, data) VALUES (?, ?)&quot;, (&#39;image&#39;, image_data)) # Commit the transaction conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . In this example, the image data is read from the &quot;image.jpg&quot; file and inserted into the &quot;images&quot; table in the &quot;database.db&quot; SQLite database. The image data is then stored as a binary blob in the &quot;data&quot; column of the table. . Converting BLOB to Image -&gt; Displaying Image . import sqlite3 from PIL import Image import io # Open a connection to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;hacksIMGdatabase.db&#39;) # Retrieve the image data from the database result = conn.execute(&quot;SELECT data FROM images WHERE name=?&quot;, (&#39;image&#39;,)).fetchone() # Convert the binary data to an image object image_data = io.BytesIO(result[0]) image = Image.open(image_data) # Display the image image.show() # Close the connection conn.close() . The image data is then retrieved from the &quot;images&quot; table using a SELECT statement with a WHERE clause that correctly matches the image name. The binary image data is then converted to an image object using the PIL library and displayed on the screen. . Popcorn Hacks #4: Using the same table, find a new .jpg image and add its image data to the database. Display the image using the PIL Library and show us the output image. import sqlite3 from PIL import Image import io # Open a connection to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;hacksIMGdatabase.db&#39;) # Read the image file as binary data with open(&#39;images/mtfuji.png&#39;, &#39;rb&#39;) as png: image_data = png.read() # Insert the image data into the database conn.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO images (name, data) VALUES (?, ?)&quot;, (&#39;mtfuji&#39;, image_data)) # Commit the transaction conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() # Open a connection to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;hacksIMGdatabase.db&#39;) # Retrieve the image data from the database result = conn.execute(&quot;SELECT data FROM images WHERE name=?&quot;, (&#39;mtfuji&#39;,)).fetchone() # Convert the binary data to an image object image_data = io.BytesIO(result[0]) image = Image.open(image_data) # Display the image image.show() # Close the connection conn.close() .

Picture Encoding . Essential Question: What are some methods that we could store and access images in the backend, and how can we send them to a frontend application? . The image encoding process for this project is done within the endpoints created on our backend application. The overarching process is split into three seperate sub-processes, each handling a different level of game-difficulty. For this lesson, we will look at the easy images sub-process as our example. . def get_random_easy_image(): images = Images.query.filter_by(_difficulty=0).all() image = random.choice(images) return image . This procedure is a void function that takes in no arguments directly, but does access the database via the Images object imported from the models that we created . The first line filters all database entries and searches for all image entries with the difficulty column set to 0, which we established as the identifying factor for easy images. The .all() method attached to the end of the query serves to return all matching image objects in a list called image. . The procedure finally returns a random image using the random.choice method. . class ImagesAPI: class _EasyImages(Resource): def get(self): image = get_random_easy_image() json_data = {} if image: image_path = project_path + &quot;/&quot; + image.imagePath with open(image_path, &quot;rb&quot;) as image_file: json_data[&quot;bytes&quot;] = str(base64.b64encode(image_file.read()))[2:][:-1] json_data[&quot;xCoord&quot;] = image.xCoord json_data[&quot;yCoord&quot;] = image.yCoord return jsonify(json_data) . If the first procedure locates and selects the image, the second procedure then encodes, formats, and returns the JSON data containing the image and its metadata. . The procedure first calls the get_random_easy_image() procedure created earlier to store our image object and also initializes an empty dictionary to store our json data. . If a valid image object is found, the procedure will attempt to create an absolute path to the image file on the computer running flask application. This is achieved by concatenating the absolute path of the working project directory to the relative image path stored in the database. The aboslute path of the directory is generated in our namespace package (__init__.py) in our _nighthawkguessr_api_ package. The line calculating the project path is shown below, and uses the Path object from the pathlib library. . project_path = Path.cwd().as_posix() . After creating the image path, the procedure attempts to open the image file, and procedes to use the base64.b64encode method to encode the image file bytes into base64 data. This is convinient for us as HTML on the frontend pages allows us to render images with base64 bytes (Not sure about normal image bytes). The base64 bytes are then encoded into a python literal string in order to be jsonified and displayed on the api endpoint. The [2:][:-1] appended to the end is a type of string slicing which removes the b&#39; generated at the start of the data and the &#39; generated at the end of the data. These extraneous characters are used to indicate a base64 string, and are not part of the original data. . The procedure finally appends the metadata (position of the right coordinates on the map) to the json_data dictionary, completing the process. . Finally, the procedure returns the JSONified data, which is accessible from our API. As you can see, the images we process are extremely large and possess high resolution (typically a few megabytes!) . Popcorn Hack: . Please write a few sentences answering the essential question, &quot;What are some methods that we could store and access images in the backend, and how can we send them to a frontend application?&quot; . Some methods that we can use to store and access images in the backend includes:database storage, cloud storage and file system storage. we can send them to a frontend application by using data urls, urls, and base64 encoding. | . Endpoints . What are endpoints and how do we use them to transfer data from one part of the internet to another? . Backend:- The backend creates endpoints that are used to edit the properties of the database constructed by the model.- GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods are used in order to define HTTP endpoints in the API. . These endpoints are based on requests that can be made to manipulate the database. | Variables defined in the model file are used to call data from the database in order to be manipulated. | . Methods in Backend Example . Modules are being imported with specified classes which are used later in the program. Blueprint: used to organize routes and functions | request: used to access data sent to the Flask app. through the HTTP request | Api: creates a Flask instance that handles requests | Resource: this allows for the definition of custom HTTP requests | reqparse: used to parse (sort and search) and validate data that is requested | . | The blueprint and api are then defined as variables and are used to store any future data that is requested. | Some preliminary functions, such as find_by_username, are created to be used later in the API code, allowing for simpler code. In this case, these functions are used to search through the database to find specific usernames. | . | . from flask import Blueprint, request from flask_restful import Api, Resource, reqparse # setting variables used to store future data leaderboard_bp = Blueprint(&quot;leaderboards&quot;, __name__) leaderboard_api = Api(leaderboard_bp) # pre-made function created to search for usernames, allows for simplified program def find_by_username(username): users = Leaderboard.query.filter_by(_username=username).all() return users[0] . GET Method . This method is used to fetch specific data points from the database by searching through the usernames. | This will be different for each type of database being made, however the general format stays the same. Since this is a text database, to pull specific information from the database, the API will query through the data using the username, which is unique. | The function defined previously, find_by_username(), is used to search through the database and pull the specific data point that is being searched. | If the user exists, the data of that user will be returned, being sent to the frontend of the program. | If a user isn&#39;t found, an error will be returned that the user does not exist. | . | In general, the program will always be searching for a piece of information that is unique and that will be used to pull data to wherever it is being requested. | . def get(self): # requested username turned into variable for later use username = request.get_json().get(&quot;username&quot;) print(username, &quot;uid&quot;) # username used to search for data and the found data is made into a variable user = find_by_username(username) if user: # data is sent to the frontend return user.to_dict() # error checking return {&quot;message&quot;: user}, 404 . POST Method . This method is used to add a specific piece of information in the database based on searching by usernames. | This is again different for each database that is made, however the general structure stays the same. In this example, a parser is being used to extract data from an incoming request. In this case, the RequestParser class is used from the Flask module. All required arguments are added to the parser, specifying what type of data it is. | The args variable is added in order to parse and store all incoming data. | . | The variable leaderboard is created to make a new object that will contain the values from the incoming data. | The function will attempt to add a new entry in the leaderboard database and return a status od a successful addition of the data. | If there is an error in the data being inputted, a status code of 500 will be returned. | . | . def post(self): # using parsers to gather and data that is to be posted and validate it&#39;s true parser = reqparse.RequestParser() parser.add_argument(&quot;username&quot;, required=True, type=str) parser.add_argument(&quot;password&quot;, required=True, type=str) parser.add_argument(&quot;pointsEasy&quot;, required=True, type=int) parser.add_argument(&quot;pointsMedium&quot;, required=True, type=int) parser.add_argument(&quot;pointsHard&quot;, required=True, type=int) # variable made to store data args = parser.parse_args() # variable created to format all data into one place and send to database for logging leaderboard = Leaderboard(args[&quot;username&quot;], args[&quot;password&quot;], args[&quot;pointsEasy&quot;], args[&quot;pointsMedium&quot;], args[&quot;pointsHard&quot;]) try: # data is sent to the database for storage db.session.add(leaderboard) db.session.commit() return leaderboard.to_dict(), 201 except Exception as e: # error checking db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . PUT Method . This method is used to update a specific piece of information in the database based on searching by usernames. | For each data base that is made, there will be different specific but the overall structure stays the same. First, the username variable is defined, which retrieves the requested username and sets it as a variable that will be used later to edit a specific dataset. | The function find_by_username() is again used to search through the data to look for the username requested. This is set to a variable to be used later. | If the username is found in the database, the rest of the dataset is updated with the new values requested. This is updated into the database. | If there is an error found with the data requested of it the user isn&#39;t found, an error is returned. | . | . def put(self): # variable created to make requested username into something that can be used to search for data in future username = request.get_json().get(&quot;username&quot;) print(username, &quot;uid&quot;) try: # attempts to find the data in the database user = find_by_username(username) if user: # if the data is found, the data points are updates user.pointsEasy = int(request.get_json().get(&quot;pointsEasy&quot;)) user.pointsMedium = int(request.get_json().get(&quot;pointsMedium&quot;)) user.pointsHard = int(request.get_json().get(&quot;pointsHard&quot;)) db.session.commit() return user.to_dict(), 201 else: # if user not found, error is returned return {&quot;message&quot;: &quot;leaderboard not found&quot;}, 404 except Exception as e: # checks for errors in request db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . DELETE Method . This method is used to delete a specific information from the database, again searching by username. | The overall structure stays the same between different databases, but the specific variables will need to be changed to personalize the database. A variable for the username is created in order to search for for the user name requested later in the code with the function find_by_username(). | If the user is found, the user is deleted, along with that user&#39;s data and the change is saved to the database. | If the user isn&#39;t found or if an error is found with the data requested, an error is returned. | . | . def delete(self): # username variable defined to store requested value username = request.get_json().get(&quot;username&quot;) print(username, &quot;uid&quot;) try: # finds the username and stores data in variable user = find_by_username(username) if user: # if the user is found, the user and their data is deleted db.session.delete(user) db.session.commit() return user.to_dict() else: # if user not found, error is returned return {&quot;message&quot;: &quot;leaderboard not found&quot;}, 404 except Exception as e: # error checking for request error db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . Displaying the Full Database . Another class is created in order to display the entire database at once and also to delete the entire database if necessary. | This uses the same functions as before to GET and DELETE the data, however it is modified slightly to look through the entire database abd display or delete all data points. | An example of where this would be useful is to create a table of data in the frontend. | . class LeaderboardListAPI(Resource): # GET method def get(self): try: # attempts to find the entire database requested and is stored in variable leaderboards = db.session.query(Leaderboard).all() # sends back the entire database return [leaderboard.to_dict() for leaderboard in leaderboards] except Exception as e: # error checking for request errors db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 # DELETE method def delete(self): try: # deletes entire database db.session.query(Leaderboard).delete() db.session.commit() return [] except Exception as e: # checks for errors in request db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . Popcorn Hacks . Please answer these questions to earn points for the popcorn hacks. . What are the four HTTP request methods that are used with Flask? | Put, post, get, delete | . What is a parser and how would it be aid with data validation? | Parser is a tool that allows you to extract structured data from unstructured or semi-structured input data for example, json. It would aid with data validation since you can prevent malformed data from causing something to break in your application. | . What is the role endpoints in Flask? In Flask, an endpoint is a function that maps to a specific URL route. When a user makes an HTTP request to a particular URL, Flask will route the request to the appropriate endpoint function based on the URL pattern. | Frontend and How it Communicates to Backend . This first part of the frontend logic simply finds out of the site is running locally or not, off of which is figures out whether or not to pull data from the local backend link or the global backend link. In this example, a global backend link hasn&#39;t been sent, however it would go in the second set of quotations after the local address. This isn&#39;t something you need to know, but it is nice to use when developing full stack applications. . // checks if site is run locally const isLocalhost = Boolean( window.location.hostname === &quot;localhost&quot; || window.location.hostname === &quot;[::1]&quot; || window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?: .(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/) ) // defines database url const api = isLocalhost ? &quot;http://localhost:8200&quot; : &quot;&quot;; . GET Method . This method is more complicated in terms of requesting, simply because in order to, for example, print all data points into a table, the function needs to iterate through the entire database. | In this example, the function getList() is used to asynchronously fetch the entire database and set it to a variable called list. The list is returned for later use outside of this function in order to print the data. | . | . Printing the Data . In order to print the data, the function getList() is run and once it is run, it iterates through the data to pull out each individual data point and enter it into the function used to make the table. For each class in the database, which is each row in the database, the variables corresponding to that specific class are pulled and inserted into the addTask() function as parameters to create the table of users. | . | The function addTask() is used to create the visual table that the user sees. A row is created and for each table cell in that row, the data is added by iterating through the array of variables that are parameters pulled directly from the database. | A new row is added into table for each new class of information pulled from the database. | . | . // fetches entire database const getList = async () =&gt; { // stores it in variable list const list = await fetch(api + &quot;/leaderboardList&quot;).then((r) =&gt; r.json()); return list }; // goes through entire database and pulls each individual class getList().then(list =&gt; { // for each class (row), data is pulled and added into addTask() function to be put in visual table list.forEach(cls =&gt; { addTask(cls.username, cls.pointsEasy, cls.pointsMedium, cls.pointsHard) }) }) // adds visual representation of data in table function addTask(username, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard) { // array of variables defining data points var tableCells = [username, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard] // creates new row in variable var row = document.createElement(&#39;tr&#39;) // goes through entire data set and places data into cells for (var i = 0; i &lt; tableCells.length; i++) { var tableCell = document.createElement(&#39;th&#39;) tableCell.textContent = tableCells[i] tableCell.className = &#39;cell&#39; row.appendChild(tableCell) } // creates new row as child of schedule element schedule.appendChild(row) } . POST Method . This method is used to push data to the backend using the HTTP POST method. The function addData is defined with the parameters that are going to be pushed into the backend. | An object is created to define the variables that are going to be pushed into the backend. This is basically the JSON string that will be sent to the backend to get decoded and inserted into the database. | The fetch() function is called with the api variable, which is a variable representing the url for the backend API, and the extension specific to where the data will be posted, in this case being /leaderboard. The method, headers, and body of the data are defined in order to complete a successful HTTP request to the backend. The object data which was created earlier, is converted to a JSON string here and sent to the backend. | . | If an error is detected, it is returned and the request will fail. | . | . // calls addData function function addData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // creates object defining the variables that will be added to the backend, corresponding with the backend variables let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // POST method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;POST&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . PUT and DELETE Methods . These two methods are almost identical to the POST method above in the way they work, the only difference being that the method requested is different. The name of the function defined is also changes, in this case being editData() and deleteData(). | . // editing function defined function editData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // has object with variables that are required in backend let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // PUT method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;PUT&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . // deleting function defined function deleteData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // object defined with variables that are same as backend let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // DELETE method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;DELETE&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . Calling Images (GET Method) . The process for calling images is basically the same as anything else, except you need to be able to reconstruct the images based on the base64 that is requested from the backend. | In this case, the image in the api is being called to the frontend and is returned as the variable list. This is then inserted directly into the html by getting the element that needs to be edited and styling with css by using the built-in function data:image/png;base64, which translated from bytes to pixel. | . | . // GET method calling info from backend url const getList = async () =&gt; { const list = await fetch(api + &quot;/api/images/GetEasyImage&quot;).then((r) =&gt; r.json()); return list }; // inserting image into frontend getList().then(list =&gt; { document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;body&quot;)[0].style = &quot;background-image: url(&#39;data:image/png;base64, &quot; + list.bytes +&quot;&#39;);&quot; }) . Popcorn Hacks . Please answer these questions to earn points for the popcorn hacks. . How is data for images stored in a Flask API and how is it displayed on the frontend when requested? | Images are stored in a Flask API by storing images as files on a server or storing image data in a database as binary data or URLs or using cloud storage services. When requested, its displayed typically using Base64. | . What is the fetch() function and how is it used in frontend logic? | fetch() allows you to make HTTP requests to a server from a frontend application and is used in frontend logic to retrieve data from a server API. | . How is data formatted and sent to the backend? (mention JSON in your answer) | When sending data to the backend in a Flask API, JSON is used to format for data serialization. JSON is easily parsed and generated by both backend and frontend applications. | . Time and Space Complexity of Algorithms . The lesson for time and space complexity of algorithms will consist of demonstrations of sorting algorithms and the different time complexities that they come with on a small scale. This can be acomplished using things such as a deck of cards or even with actual people. An example of how this will work is laying out the cards in a random order on the table, and demonstrating different ways of sorting it. From methods such as bubble sort to methods such as bogo sort, it will be really easy to see exactly how much time it would take for these different sorting algoritms to complete. Then after that, it is easy to understand the concept of time complexity when given a real world example. . Space complexity can be demonstrated by using the same method, however, adding in the extra step of having the cards in a pile. This will show how much space is needed to complete the sorting algorithm. This will easily reveal the concept of space complexity because it allows people to witness a real world, physical example of the concept, turning a really hard to grasp concept into something that is easy to understand. . Additionally, we are also going to analyze certain algorithms within our project to show how such analysis is applicable to real world projects. . Essential Question: What is the quicksort algorithm, and how does it work? How does it&#39;s time and space complexities scale with input sizes? . QuickSort Algorithm . The main algorithm we&#39;ve employed is an recursive implementation of quickSort in the backend to sort the database entries to obtain the user with the highest overall score. Typically this algorithm is implemented to sort in ascending order, but to make it easier to extract the top 10 users, we sill be modifying the algorithm to sort in descending order (so the top players show up first in the list). . class LeaderboardTop10(Resource): def partition(self, arr, lo, hi): pivot = arr[hi][1] # Pivot value set to the 2nd index of the last element pivot_pos = lo - 1 # Set our base pivot position, ensure that lower picoit index == lo for idx in range(lo, hi): # Iterate over all elements in the partition array if arr[idx][1] &gt;= pivot: # Found an element creater than pivot pivot_pos+=1 # Increment correct position for pivot arr[pivot_pos], arr[idx] = arr[idx], arr[pivot_pos] # Swap the larger element with the element at the current pivot position arr[pivot_pos + 1], arr[hi] = arr[hi], arr[pivot_pos + 1] # Swap element at pivot position with the pivot element return pivot_pos+1 # Return index of pivot element def qSortUserList(self, arr, lo, hi): if lo &lt; hi: last_pivot = self.partition(arr, lo, hi) self.qSortUserList(arr, lo, last_pivot-1) self.qSortUserList(arr, last_pivot+1, hi) def get(self): users_list = get_user_list() top10 = {} self.qSortUserList(users_list, 0, len(users_list)-1) for user in users_list: top10[user[0]] = user[1] print(top10) if len(top10) &lt;= 10: return top10 return top10[:10] . To understand how the algorithm first, we must first familiarize ourselves with the process. . Our backend grabs all users from our leaderboard | Returns all users and their scores in a 2-D array, each element is a list of length two that contains the username and cumulative score of the player | The sorting algorithm will use the second element representing the user score to sort the array of users. ┌─────────────────────┐ ┌──────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ Split │ │ display │ │ Database │ │ the ├──────────────► sorted list │ │ │ │ List into │ │ on endpoint │ │ │ │ top 10 users │ │ │ └──────────┬──────────┘ └─────────▲────────┘ └─────────────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ┌──────────▼──────────┐ ┌─────────┴────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ 2-D User Array │ │ QuickSort │ │ ├───────────────► │ │ [(username, score)] │ │ Algorithm │ │ │ │ │ └─────────────────────┘ └──────────────────┘ . Our quickSort algorithm consists of 2 procedures, a partition() procedure that pivots and sorts individual elements, and a qSortUserList() that performs recursion which finishes the sorting. | The Logic . The partition procedure will serve to &quot;partition&quot; our list into 2 parts, a smaller portion and a larger portion around a certain pivot value (Note: These portions don&#39;t have to sorted yet!). . Partition procedure . First, partition selects a certain element in a list to be a pivot. This pivot value will be used to make comparisons to every other value in the array. For simplicity, we have selected our pivot element as the last element in the unsorted list. The procedure defines a pivot_pos variable to denote the correct position of the pivot index after each iteration. Although it may seem weird that the variable intially starts with a value of 0-1 = -1, this negative index is resolved by the return statement, which always returns an index that&#39;s one higher than pivot_pos. This serves to ensure that the lowest pivot index would be 0, which is the smallest element in any given partition. . pivot = arr[hi][1] pivot_pos = lo - 1 . The partition will then iterate over each element in the list from the starting and ending indexes indicated by the parameters. if a particular value is found to be larger than the pivot, the algorithm well then increment the recorded pivot position and swap the pivot with the found element. . for idx in range(lo, hi): if arr[idx][1] &gt;= pivot: pivot_pos+=1 arr[pivot_pos], arr[idx] = arr[idx], arr[pivot_pos] . Finally, the partition procedure swaps the element at the pivot_pos+1 index with our pivot element at the hi index to place the pivot at it&#39;s rightful place. We know that pivot_pos+1 must be smaller than hi because it did not trigger the conditional to increment the `pivot_pos+1`` index. At last, the pivot_pos is incremented and returned to serve as an indicator of where our two partitions split. . arr[pivot_pos + 1], arr[hi] = arr[hi], arr[pivot_pos + 1] return pivot_pos+1 . qSort procedure . If the parition procedure splits our list into smaller and larger regions, then our qSort procedure ensures that these regions are in order. It&#39;s hard to explain, but the procedure iterates over each paritition, repeating the paritition process, setting new pivot values, and correctly places the pivot values at their correct sorted order. . The procedure first checks if the lower index is smaller than the higher index, to ensure that our parition has a length greater than 1. If this check passes, the procedure then calls the partition procedure to both split our list into the two distinct regions and also the index of our correctly placed pivot value. The procedure then invokes itself again on the larger interval (replacing hi to be the partition index-1 since the previous pivot is already sorted), and also on the smaller interval (replacing lo to be partition index+1). . Eventually, the qSort procedure will iterate through all elements in the list while parition places each element at the correct position, giving us the final sorted list. . Complexity analysis . To analyze time complexity, we must analyze the partition and qSort procedures. . For the qSort procedure, because we divide the array into 2 halves during each function call, our number of function calls scales proportionally to log(n), where n is the length of the input array. However, within each function call, we also call the partition procedure, which contains an for-loop that iterates over each element in the partioned array, comparing it to a pivot value. We are well familiar with since loops, and can safely say that runtime scales proportionally to the length of the partition array. Due to this, we can conclude that our iteration time complexity scales linearly. Thus for each iterative process, our timerun scales proportionally to n. . Finally, we could multiply our two complexities together to get a representation of our overall complexity. Thus, the asymptotic notation for a time complexity could be represented as O(nlogn), where n is the length of the input array. Keep in mind, Big-Oh notation is not a function that returns the accurate runtime for any given input, but rather only gives us a model to see how runtime scales with increasing input sizes. . Space complexity for this program is much easier to analyze. Because the array is sorted in-place (meaning we don&#39;t create other placeholders or copies), we require no additional space to sort this array. However, recursive function calls may require extra storage on the call stack. Since we found the number of recursive calls to be asymptotic to O(logn), we can conclude that quickSort has an O(1) space complexity for an iterative method, and an O(logn) space complexity for a recursive method. . Popcorn Hack . Please answer our EQ for this section: What is the quicksort algorithm, and how does it work? How does it&#39;s time and space complexities scale with input sizes? . It&#39;s a sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort an array of elements. You select a &quot;pivot&quot; element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

Here we initialize the total population to be 50, then set the growth factor as 1.00005 (.005 percent change). It will print the population every 56th day until it reaches one million. It multiplies the current population by the growth factor in each iteration, and increments the day count. When the day count reaches 56, it prints the current population and resets the day count to 0. . Note! This simulation assumes that the growth factor remains constant as time progresses, which may not be a realistic assumption in real-world scenarios. . import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Define the initial population and growth rate population = 100 growth_rate = 0.05 # Define the number of years to simulate num_years = 50 # Create lists to store the population and year values populations = [population] years = [0] # Simulate population growth for the specified number of years for year in range(1, num_years+1): # Calculate the new population size new_population = population + (growth_rate * population) # Update the population and year lists populations.append(new_population) years.append(year) # Set the new population as the current population for the next iteration population = new_population # Plot the population growth over time plt.plot(years, populations) plt.xlabel(&#39;Year&#39;) plt.ylabel(&#39;Population&#39;) plt.title(&#39;Population Growth Simulation&#39;) plt.show() .

Simulation Question Answers: . Answer is A and B because they are able to track which ride is the most popular. | Answer is A because rabbit population growth already takes into account grass, and it can be assumed that there is a certain constant amount of grass. | Answer is B because the hole isn&#39;t going to be refilled if processes occur as usual. Also, the depth of the hole is not being tracked in this simulation. | Answer is D because a simulation is flexible and less time-consuming. | Answer is B and C because it can provide data very efficiently and can also take into account many different specific variables. | Answer is C. Simulations aren&#39;t real-world things so assumptions have to be made in order to make the simulation possible. |",

Complete the network activity, summarize your understanding of fault tolerance. i. Yes the network is fault tolerant, as if any link or any points is broken the information can still be distributed to other points in the system. | ii. No the network is not fault tolerant, as if node C goes down, then information can’t be sent to F and thus it is not fault tolerant. | iii. No the network is not fault tolerant, as if node G comes down, then information can’t be sent to A and thus the system cannot be described as fault tolerant. Option C | Option A | The importance of fault tolerance is that there is redundancy in your system and one faulty link doesn’t compromise the entire system and information can still be transmitted throughout the entire system. The internet is an example of such a system as if one link is broken, the information can still be sent through other links while the broken link is being repaired. Thus it is vital to create fault tolerant systems with at least one backup link or node per connection in case of a failure. | | . | . Parallel and Distributed Computing . Review previous lecture on Parallel Computing and watch Daily video 4.3. Think of ways to make something in you team project to utilize Cores more effectively. Here are some thoughts to add to your story of Computers and Networks… . What is naturally Distributed in Frontend/Backend architecture? In a frontend/backend architecture, the frontend and backend are naturally distributed components. The frontend typically consists of the user interface and presentation layer, while the backend contains the business logic and data storage. The frontend is distributed across multiple devices or clients, such as web browsers, mobile devices, or desktop applications. Each client has its own instance of the frontend code, which communicates with the backend over a network connection. The backend is typically deployed on one or more servers or cloud platforms. The servers may be physically distributed across multiple locations, and the backend may be composed of multiple services or microservices that work together to provide the required functionality. The distributed nature of the frontend/backend architecture allows for scalability, fault tolerance, and performance optimization. The frontend can be scaled by adding more clients or instances, while the backend can be scaled by adding more servers or services. Fault tolerance can be achieved by replicating the backend across multiple servers or locations, and load balancing can be used to optimize performance by distributing the load across multiple servers. Overall, the frontend/backend architecture is a popular and effective way of building modern web applications that can handle large volumes of users and data. | . | Analyze this command in Docker: ENV GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS=&quot;--workers=1 --bind=0.0.0.0:8086&quot;. Determine if there is options are options in this command for parallel computing within the server that runs python/gunicorn. Here is an article The GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS environment variable is used to set command-line arguments for the Gunicorn web server when it starts up. In the provided command, --workers=1 and --bind=0.0.0.0:8086 are specified as arguments. To run the Gunicorn server in parallel, you can increase the number of worker processes to handle multiple requests simultaneously. To do this, simply set the --workers argument to a higher number. For example, if you want to run four worker processes, you can set the argument to --workers=4. It&#39;s important to note that the number of workers you can run at once will depend on the resources available on your system and the workload your application is handling. Be careful not to increase the number of workers beyond what your system can handle, as this can cause performance issues or even crashes. To make sure everything is running smoothly, it&#39;s a good idea to monitor the resource usage of the worker processes while the server is running with multiple workers. You can use tools like htop, top, or systemd to keep an eye on things. In summary, to run the Gunicorn server in parallel, set the --workers argument to a number that your system can handle, and keep an eye on the resource usage of the worker processes to ensure everything stays stable. | . | .

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # I noticed that only the 1,2,3 are in the output, and the 2,1 are not included in the output. # # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables as they both involve unique values. # . {1, 2, 3} .

The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows.

An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . 263 Alabama . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . 178 1.78 . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) . Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . [[18, 28], [18, 28]] . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . 263 . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) print(fibonacci(30)) # print(fibonacci(40)) . 832040 . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1,2,3])) print(generate_subsets([1,2,3,4,5])) #print(generate_subsets(numbers)) . Using the time library, we are able to see the difference in time it takes to calculate the fibonacci function above. . Based on what is known about the other time complexities, hypothesize the resulting elapsed time if the function is replaced. | . import time start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(34)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(35)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) . 5702887 Time taken: 1.7146875858306885 seconds 9227465 Time taken: 3.6633431911468506 seconds . Hacks . Record your findings when testing the time elapsed of the different algorithms. Findings: | constant O(1) and logarithmic O(logn) seem to run in the shortest amount of time. | Linear O(n) is the next shortest amount of time. | Exponential O(n^2) starts of with a short amount of time, but the time increases exponentially for each time you increase the number in the parameter by 1. | Quadratic O(n^2) seems to take the most amount of time. | All depends on the quantity. The O with an exponent in the time are faster when the list is shorter. | . | Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. Selection sort: Finds the lowest values and swaps it with the number in the first position. In the second position, the number moves to the third position. If the swap between second and third position puts the next lowest number in the second position, the now third position moves on. This sequence continues until the list is completely sorted. | Bubble sort: Two sets of numbers are sorted each time. They are sorted to make the lower number go behind the higher one. It continues to sort it in pairs until it reaches the last number. The algorithm then sorts it in pairs starting at the first position again, and keeps doing this. Once it is complete, the algorithm has to run again with no swapped numbers to verify that the entire list is sorted. | Insertion sort: Similar to bubble sort, but if it does swap two values, it tracks the lower value by going back a position and keeps sorting that lower value until it is in the right place. | . | Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? Time and space complexity is important when choosing an algorithm because you need time-efficiency, so that consumers and your coworkers can be more productive when using the algorithm. You also do not have unlimited space, so reducing the space as much as possible can save more storage for other purposes and can save more money. | . | Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? No. Constant time algorithms are useful for sorting large amounts of data. Exponential time algorithms are useful for sorting smaller amounts of data, and if it is small enough it can actually be more efficient than constant time algorithms. | . | What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? All of them involve lists. They also all involve some sort of mathematical calculations. Binary search seems to include logarithm algorithm, and exponential can also involve number theory. Complete the Time and Space Complexity analysis questions linked below. Practice | . | . Questions: . Answer is 2. Space requires N and M, so space is O(N+M).

If there is an error with executing the code, except occurs and executes the below code. This is useful because you can write code that continues to run even after hitting a problem or error. | What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? | The code conn.cursor, cursor.execute, conn.commit, and cursor/conn.close is repeated. It is repeated because it constantly has to set up a cursor object and connection object.

Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

After finishing the snake game by hitting the wall or the snake itself, a form is displayed to allow the user to input their username. After the form is complete, the data is added into the database and is displayed on the leaderboard. . 3.a.iii. . After the snake game is over, the user inputs a three-letter username. The score is automatically inputted for the user. The outcome of the program is a table of the five top scorers, displaying the username, score, and date of the game. . 3.b.i. . . 3.b.ii. . . 3.b.iii. . The variable, or constant is body is the name of the dictionary. . 3.b.iv. . The variable body obtains the data values from the username input and the score, representing the details of the user’s profile. . 3.b.v. . The dictionary in the variable body helps to create separate, distinct packets of information specifically for one user. Without the use of this dictionary, the database would not be able to distinguish which score corresponds to which username. This can make the program code harder to create as there would have to be a separate, more complex algorithm which manually sorts the data already present in the database. . 3.c.i. . . 3.c.ii. . . 3.c.iii. . The procedure add_row() adds a row on the table of the leaderboard, and displays the username, score, and date based on the user’s inputs and the data from the API. This helps to display the data from user inputs onto the leaderboard so that other users are able to see the top scorers of the game. . 3.c.iv. . The algorithm fetches the API using its URL to execute the GET method. It then checks that a successful fetch will be guaranteed, and if it is, then a response is carried out. An if statement is used to check if the response has an error with reading the database. If there is an error, an error message is displayed on the table of the leaderboard, and the entire function fetching the API is stopped. However, if there is no error, the algorithm proceeds to check that the response contains JSON data. If it does contain JSON data, the algorithm proceeds to sort the users, where the highest scoring user is displayed first and the lowest scoring user is displayed last. Next, a for loop is used so that only the top 5 scoring users are displayed onto the leaderboard, and their profiles are displayed by calling the add_row() function. Finally, the algorithm checks for any fetch errors, and if there is a fetch error, an error message is displayed onto the table of the leaderboard. . 3.d.i. . First Call: The first call is when the user clicks on the leaderboard website, which calls the function that fetches the API with a functional URL. . Second Call: The second call is when the user clicks on the leaderboard website, which calls the function that fetches the API while the URL is down.’ . Condition(s) tested by first call: The first call checks the errors and successfully determines that there are no errors with fetching the data. As a result, the data from the user input is sorted based on the user’s score using the response.json().then() command. . Condition(s) tested by second call: The second call checks fetch errors using the .catch() command. Since the URL to the API is down, a fetch error will prompt the .catch() command to function. . Results of first call: The first call displays the user onto the leaderboard given that it is a top five scorer. . Results of the second call: An error message is displayed on the leaderboard and no user data is displayed. .",

However, PII should only be used to a limited extent, since bank accounts and social security numbers are usually not needed and can be threatening to one’s financial situation if leaked. If some PII are not needed, then it certainly shouldn’t be asked for. I believe that my personal exposure is more on the secretive or defensive side. When I sign up on most websites, I usually enter a fake birthday or name in order to hide my identity for security reasons. | A good password is a very long and randomized password with a different variety of characters. A bad password is one that has an obvious pattern or is not unique, like 1234. Another step for authentication could be to use a finger print scanner, face scanner, or eye scanner(biometric things) | Symmetric encryption is where only one secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt info. Asymmetric cryptography uses one public key and one private key to encrypt and decrypt a message and protect it from unauthorized access. | The use of certbot to make our website secure is an example of encryption. | I have never fallen for a phishing scheme, but I was very close to falling for one. One time, I was randomly taken to a McAfee website(An antivirus software) that said I had viruses on my computer and it had a huge button saying something like “eliminate all viruses.” I nearly clicked it until my parents told me not to. I looked at the URL and later noticed that it was completely different from McAfee’s official website, so I realized that it was a phishing scheme. Some other possible phishing techniques are alarming messages saying that your bank account has been compromised, and that there is a button below which fixes the problem. The button will probably install a virus onto your computer. |",

The data says that Tiktok is more appealing to teenagers and kids than Facebook does. There is a slight exclusion in these platforms as the colorful backgrounds in Tiktok creates the impression that it’s only suitable for young people. It is not very harmful because different age groups tend to use different apps. There is not much harm with one age group using an app more often. However, for example, if an old person uses Tiktok, they might have a feeling of being excluded. It should be corrected because by accomodating all ages it can make everyone have a sense of belonging. It is good business to correct it because then more and more people from different age groups will use the app. . Virtual assistants have female voices because of societal standards, which suggests that females should be of service to males. It is harmful because it puts females at an inferior position to males. It should be corrected in order to prevent people from thinking that gender determines your social hierarchy. However, it is good business as more males use voice assistants, and they tend to prefer female voices over male voices becuase female voices sound more soothing. . The algorithm that helps give you content you often search up influences my decisions. As more and more young people search topics associated with them, it starts to appeal more to younger audiences. This is vice versa with older people. . HP Computers are Racist . The owner of the computer does not think it is intentional because he is making a joke out of it. | I think this happened because when testing the algorithm more white people were used as samples for testing than black people. | This is harmful because some races do not get the same benefits as other races.

APIs used: . We’ve used COVID APIs | Weather API was used | Jokes API was used | A prototype high scores API was also used in my project | . Github discovery: The biggest discovery I found in Github was that a random person starred my fastpages repository. I could then find his profile and discovered that he was a software engineer or something similar. . After examining the datasets on Kaggle, I noticed that many of the databases were related to political and economic issues. There were things about transportation, COVID cases, political elections, etc. . Hacks . One crowdsourcing idea is to develop an algorithm to identify people based on their hand shapes and patterns.

The great amount of competition can lead to addiction or spending too much time playing the game for a high score. | Pros and Cons of Internet Blockers and Lack of Admin Passwords(5.1): . Pros: . Internet blockers can help prevent people from gaming, watching videos and movies, and doing off-task activities during class. | The lack of admin passwords on computers at school can make signing into computers much more efficient without having to consistently ask an adult for the password. | . Cons: . Internet blockers can prevent students from using websites or apps related to school work. This can decrease the productivity in class activities as it is more of a hassle to work with website blockages. | The lack of admin passwords can also decrease the amount of security of the computer. This makes school computers more prone to hacking and unauthorized computer usage. | . My Concerns about the Digital Divide(5.2): . My concerns about the digital divide are the fact that society is starting to become more and more reliant on computers and similar machines. If people cannot access these kinds of technology, then they will fall more and more behind with education and work. The COVID pandemic is an example. If people do not have access to computers, then distance learning would be impossible and they would fall very behind on school work, leading to a bad education and a less successful career later on. My other concern about the digital divide is the fact that computers are very expensive. The cheapest computers are several hundred dollars, and if some families cannot afford computers, then they will fall behind in school and work. This will widen the rich-poor gap as those with low-incomes are increasingly at a disadvantage. These problems can be solved by sharing computers or donating computers to those who cannot afford them. .",

I got this wrong because by the last step “sheep” would already have the “goats” value in it, so “goats” would still remain as “goats.” . Question 14 . . Input A must be “true” because if A was false, then two of the same values in a OR operator would return false, which would make the output after the AND operator as false. . Question 16 . . The algorithm is choosing which numbers are even. This requires selection. . Question 22 . . Both algorithms work because algorithm A adds all the students’ values and discards the previously added value. The end value would result in the sum of all the students’ heights, so algorithm A works. . Question 33 . . Algorithm I doesn’t work for values less than -1. If all values are less than -1, then the max would be -1. However, this is not the case as no values are -1. . Question 34 . . The answer is 10(A) because in binary search the list of 500 elements is “cut in half” ten times. . Question 42 . It’s D because III is also correct.

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

(record below) . 3.18: Undecidable Problems . Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the concept of undecidable problems in computer science and to explain why these problems are important. . Key vocabulary: . Decision problem | Decidable problem | Undecidable problem | . Decision Problem . A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs:&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over: . Decidable Problems | Undecidable Problems | . A __ is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not. . An __ problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem. . Decidable Problems . A decidable problem is an algorithm that can always have an output of yes or no given any input. It is always correct. . Example of a Decidable Problem . The procedure below tests to see if a number is divisible by 13. If it is, it returns true. If it isn&#39;t, it returns false. . def divideThirteen(number): if number % 13 == 0: return True else: return False print(divideThirteen(26)) print(divideThirteen(30)) . True False . Undecidable Problems . An Example of a Forever Running Code . The code keeps adding 1 to the variable number until number is no longer an integer(This is not the python data type &quot;integer&quot;, it&#39;s the integer in number theory). However, there is no end to this code, making the computer run forever. There is no halt to the code. . i = 0 number = 1 def integerTest(n): # Testing if the number is an integer if n%1 ==0: return True else: return False # Using while loop to keep searching an a non-integer above 1. Note that the computer runs forever. while i == 0: number += 1 if integerTest(number) == False: i +=1 print(&quot;Done&quot;) . Delete the parentheses later below. . The Halting Problem . The halting problem is an example of an __(undecidable problem). It states that it is not always possible to correctly determine whether a code halts or runs forever. . There is __(no way) to write an algorithm to analyze and determine whether a body of code can run forever or not. . THe Halting Problem Example: . In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let&#39;s call this algorithm HaltChecker. | HaltChecker analyzes the program,program P, and its input,input I. If program P halts with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;halts&quot;. If program P doesn&#39;t halt(runs forever) with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. For example, in the code where it tests if variable number, the __(code runs forever), so HaltChecker returns an output of __(&quot;never&quot;). | Then, we add another algorithm called Reverser which reverses HaltChecker&#39;s output. So, if &quot;never&quot; is the output of HaltChecker, then the output of Reverser is __(&quot;halts&quot;). It&#39;s also the same the other way around: if HaltChecker has an output of &quot;halts&quot;, then Reverser has an output of __(&quot;never&quot;). | We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code. | Since Reverser is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints &quot;never&quot; when in fact there is an end(As proved by HaltChecker), and how it also prints &quot;halts&quot; when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by HaltChecker). As a result, HaltChecker is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem. | . This Diagram Sums up the Entire Process in the Bulleted List: . Credits of diagram and example to Khan Academy . FAQ . Q: If Reverser is causing the problem, why not remove it? | A: Removing Reverser will remove the problems, however, we are looking for ways which create the problem of not outputting a correct result. One example is enough to prove that it is an undecidable problem since it proves that the code is not completely accurate. | . Extra Things to Notice . Note that while a computer may take a long time to run a section of code, it does not mean that the computer is going to run forever. | Humans are able to solve some undecidable problems. The entire Halting Problem example was to prove that computers cannot solve undecidable problems. | . Hacks . Come up with one situation in which a computer runs into an undecidable problem.

HP Inc.: Create technology that makes life better for everyone, every where. | Qualcomm: Investing the tech the world loves. | Thermo Fisher Scientific: Enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer. . | Thermo Fisher is the world leader in serving science | Our work right now can impact the market | Doing something impactful can be a factor when you choose your job | Roles of scrum master, devOps, frontend, and backend are related to real life work situations. | . Notes from presentation of a software engineer: . Your interests right now don’t determine what passions you have and job you want to do in the future. | Center for Embedded Network Sensors(CENS) | DevOps: Has a responsibility for security and preventing sites from getting hacked | Worst thing possible is to get bored of a job, you can learn stuff while working if the topics are interesting | Computer and tech jobs are in high demand | . Extra Notes: . Be flexible. According to the presenters, they have all switched to many jobs at different companies | The best workers listen to the requirements, and are able to translate the technology to how to solve the requirements | Qualcomm is a semiconductor industry | Qualcomm is the “big fish in a pond” | Being able to pass by completing coding tasks in 35-45 min is very hard but it is in the real world | If you know how to code, it’s a way of thinking. Coding teaches you how to do critical thinking and problem solving, and it’s important to know how you came up with your process and answer. | Example situation: You are in a room with only a notebook and pencil. You are asked, “how many cars are in the US?” The boss will look for the process of you getting an assumption, not how correct your answer is | Algorithms helps with trading stocks as you have to analyze patterns | . Summary and Lessons . I learned and explored the field of technology and software engineering. One interesting thing I learned was the the devOps responsibility is to maintain the security of the sites. I was not aware that security played a factor in creating coding projects. Another thing I learned is to be flexible. The presenters for today worked at many different jobs and switched majors as well as discovered new passions. Therefore, I shouldn’t be too stubborn and have an all-or-nothing mindset when finding out my major or jobs. I also learned about different major companies and how they operated. Thermo Fisher is the world’s largest supplier of science materials, and Qualcomm is also at one point the world’s largest supplier of phone chips. Finally, I learned that coding not only teaches me about coding, but it also teaches me skills of critical thinking, problem solving, and explanation of a process. Overall, this presentation I listened to today can help me with my future by teaching me important lessons of critical thinking, as well as being flexible with what I am passionate about. Most important lesson learned is continuous learning .",

            "content": "Calling Procedures . Slide 1: . A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programing language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called. | . Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a boolean or value, then you will assign that value to a variable | . Slide 3: . Assume the Temperature outside is Fahrenheit. | The procedure convertFahrenheit is intended to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius. | Convert the following pseudocode to python | . def convertFahrenheit(temp): # code goes here celsius = temp-32 celsius *= 5/9 return celsius outsideTemp = input(&quot;Input temp in celsius&quot;) outsideTemp = convertFahrenheit(int(outsideTemp)) print(outsideTemp) . 32.22222222222222 . Developing Procedures . Slide 8: . Picking a descriptive name is important in case you revisit the code later on (separate words with capitals) There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements Steps of developing procedure: picking a useful name, thinking of parameters (what data does the procedure need to know), making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure. . Slide 9: . In this example, a teacher is writing a program that will replace the grade on a previous quiz if the new grade is better than the previous. . What would be a good name for this procedure? | What parameters do we need for this procedure? | Try writing this procedure out in python based on the given pseudocode | . def quizCalc(quizGrade, currentPoints): currentGrade = int(currentPoints) / 40 currentGrade = currentGrade * 100 if currentGrade &gt; int(quizGrade): quizGrade = currentGrade return str(currentGrade) prevQuiz = input(&quot;Input your previous quiz score out of 40.&quot;) nowQuiz = input(&quot;Input your current quiz score out of 40.&quot;) print(&quot;Previous quiz score: &quot;, prevQuiz) print(&quot;Current quiz score: &quot;, nowQuiz) print(&quot;Current grade: &quot;, quizCalc(prevQuiz, nowQuiz)) . Previous quiz score: 30 Current quiz score: 35 Current grade: 87.5 . Procedural Abstraction . One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it | This is very helpful in managing complexity in a program | Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called modularity | A procedural abstraction may extract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity | When a pre-written procedure is called, you don’t necessarily need to know the details of this, just what it does and how to call it | Simply, procedural abstraction is naming and calling a prewritten procedure | Making sure to include the right arguments so the procedure can do what its supposed to do is crucial | . Complexity Example . One of the biggest advantages of procedural abstraction is managing complexity. . Think about the process of simplifying the code? What do you think the advantage of the code segment on the left is? . Code Segment 1 Code Segment 2 . ROTATE_LEFT() | detourLeft() | .

The lesson will start off with introducing what algorithms are and what they do, moreover, what their significance is. . 3.9 Lesson 1 has the objective to teach the student of the outcome of similar algorithmic concepts and similar algorithms. In this lesson, you will see different ways on how algorithms are developed. . Lesson 1 | Defining Algorithms . What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed through CODE. There are set limitations, this is what makes algorithms fun, you can your imagination and create whatever you wan with your own instructions! . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks . | Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results. . | Some conditional statements can be written as the same as Boolean expressions (VICE VERSA) . | Different algorithms can be developed or use to solve the same problem. . | . Example 1 | What happens if we test the algorithm with different outputs? . The pseudocode above is translated to python for you. . Record what your outputs are when you enter 95 degrees F, does the algorithm yield the same result? . Both algorithms yield the same output when you enter 95 degrees F . The conditional below is nested . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then 95, what do you notice? . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then Input 95, what do you notice? . NOW RECORD with another output . Record what your outputs are when you enter 54, does the algorithm yield the same result this time? . *Now use 95 as an input for the two code blocks above. . Even though an algorithm&#39;s code can look the same, you have to be careful, they can always yield different results. When constructing algorithms you want to make sure that your code corresponds with what you want as your output. You set the limit of your code and you decide what the code&#39;s output is. . Conditionals vs. Booleans . The condition and instructions are what differ, that&#39;s where the magic happens. The condition is a boolean expression when an expression outputs either true or false. Boolean values are another type of data type in programming languages, and they can only ever hold true or false. . Exercise . Learning how to utilize conditionals and booleans are important for developing algorithms. Use this exercise to help you. . Can either Boolean expression on the right replace the conditional on the left? Assume isWeekday and isHoliday are Boolean variables. . *NOTE = you can edit the variables to check the conditions needed! . IsHoliday = False IsWeekday = True if IsHoliday: driveWork = True else: if IsWeekday: driveWork = True else: driveWork = False print(driveWork) . Logically thinking about conditionals and booleans . Now the problem may seem confusing, but the best way to develop an algorithm is to think about all the possible results that can be potentially be outputted. . So if IsHoliday is set to true, then driveWork is automatically equal to false and it does not matter what value of isWeekday is. This must mean that one of the conditionals must be NOT IsHoliday. . In the case that lets say IsHoliday is set to false, then the variable for weekday needs to be checked. If it&#39;s true then driveWork is true, if it&#39;s false then driveWork is false. This must mean that the other conditional isWeekday. . Combining both conditionals, you get option 2, which is not IsHoliday and IsWeekday. This is why option 2 is right! . Example 3 | Conditionals vs Booleans . The following algorithms are intended to sum the odd numbers from 1-9. Which algorithms work as intended? . Below, I have translated the block code into python, import this to your jupyter notebook and record the result. What do you notice? . First block . sum = 1 counter = 3 #iteration var = 0 while (var &lt; 4): #while the var is &lt;= 4, it executes those commands, once it exceeds it hits the else command sum = sum + counter counter = counter + 2 var = var + 1 # now go through the whole thing 4 times, this is an iteration, a vital part of algorithms. else: print(sum) . 25 . Second block . sum = 0 counter = 9 #iteration while (counter &gt;= 1): sum = sum + counter counter = counter - 2 print(sum) . 25 . When we start our initializing left sum as 1 counter as 3 we had no iterations yet. Remember we&#39;re going to have to repeat this four times because the block code prompts us to repeat 4 times, so we iterate. So as we go through and follow what the block gives us. . So you see that the sum does work, it does sum up the odd numbers from 1-9 . Now lets look at the right block. . Sum is set to 0 Counter is set to 9 We must repeat until the counter &lt; 1 is true. . So we keep adding until -1, that is when the counter &lt; 1 is true, so we stop . So why is it important to understand that algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same task? . An algorithm is beautiful that way, just because you think of solving a problem differently, doesn&#39;t mean your wrong, . 3.9 Part 2 . Flowcharts . Flowcharts can help you visualize the functionality of an algorithm . | They are a good way to double check whether or not your algorithm is achieving its purpose . | . How To Set Up A Flowchart . label the start point . | Define any and all variables you may need . | Consider the first question you want the algorithm to ask . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is yes (or true) . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is no (or false) . Steps 3-5 are the steps to creating code that uses a process called selection (you can convert the question from step 3 to a conditional if-statement in code) | . | Write out all necessary steps for the algorithm to function properly . | You may want your algorithm to iterate some steps until a condition is met . You can write the steps that need to be repeated, then draw an arrow from the last step to a step above that contains a conditional statement | . | determine a way to reach the end goal | Selection vs. Iteration . Selection: . A process used in algorithms where a conditional if-statement leads to one of two outcomes . Outcome 1: if the conditional statement is true, something will happen . | Outcome 2: if the conditional statement is false, something else will happen . | . | . | . Iteration . A process used in algorithms that allows certain things to happen until a condition is satisfied . Once the condition is satisfied, then an outcome is produced . | This can take the form of a for-loop, while-loop, and/or if-statement . | . | . | . Example A . Consider this situation: . You are shopping for your favorite food at your favorite supermarket . | You see that there is a sale on wheat products for 35% off . | There is another sale on produce for 20% off . | These sales are mutually exclusive . | Tax on all items is 8% . | . | Your TASK: . Create a flowchart for an algorithm that can be used to calculate the cost of your favorite item | . | . Example A Possible Solution (using Selection) . 3.9 Part 3 . For Algorithms How to combine and/or modify an existing algorithm. | . | . Benefits of combining algorithms can reduce development time, testing time, and simplify the identification of errors. | . | . Rules . step/rule 1: start with any positive integer | step/rule 2: if the preceding term is even; divide by 2 | step/rule 3: if the preceding term is odd; multiply by 3 and add 1 | step/rule 4: repeat steps until you arrive at 1 | fact: the sequence should ALWAYS end up at 1 if repeated. | . Algorithm to Start (Determining Whether a Number is Even or Odd) . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) if (varx %2 == 0): print(&quot;the number is even&quot;) else: print(&quot;the number is odd&quot;) # Run this cell to see how it works . choose value for x the number is even . How can we modify this code to match our goal . Hint: uses arithmetic operations | Hint: look at the steps of the equation and try and modify it to fit them | Must display all numbers used in it | . Solution . Step 1 . steps/rules 2 &amp; 3. | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) if (varx %2 == 0): varx == varx/2 # Change print to the function else: varx == varx * 3 + 1 # Change print to the function print(varx) . Step 2 . step/rule 4; here we add the loop | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) while varx != 1: if (varx %2 == 0): varx = varx/2 # Change print to the function else: varx = varx * 3 + 1 # Change print to the function print(varx) . Step 3 . Display all values throughout the algorithm | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) print(varx) while varx != 1: if (varx %2 == 0): varx = varx/2 print(varx) # add Display else: varx = varx * 3 + 1 print(varx) # add Display print(varx) # Final # Should be 1 every time . Takeaways . You can use code you&#39;ve previously wrote in order to make a project easier. | Breaking algorithms down into steps can make things easier and more simple. | . Hacks . create another algorithm using a famous mathematical algorithm such as the &quot;collatz conjecture.&quot; and explain your steps in a post on a blog. | . 3.11 Binary Search . Goals/Objectives: . detirmine number of iterations required to find vlue in data set. | explain requirements for binary search | . What is Binary Search? . Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. | An algorithm for iterating to find a value inside a data set | . About Binary Search: . Binary Search Algorithm starts in the middle of a data set of numbers and eliminates half the data. This process reapeats until the desired value is found or until all elements have been eliminated. | In order to use binary search effectivly and properly, data must be stored in order | COLLEGE BOARD INDEX STARTS AT 1 NOT 0 | . Think about how you would you would try to find a certain number in this set. . One way would be to line up the numbers and count them individually untill you find the desired value. . When working with large data sets with lots of numbers, methods like these wont work . Instead, a Binary Search would be more effective. | . Here we can see the numbers are set in an increasing order. Setting numbers in an increasing or decreasing is needed for a binary search . Binary search is started with the middle number first Middle number is found by taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two | . | Binary Search can be represented using a tree as shown below | . . Heres an easy way to put it: . binary search fidns the desired element by continuously chopping the search area in half | say the element you are looking for is &#39;f&#39; | . [a b c d e f g h] . We would start in the middle at element &#39;d&#39; | becuase our target is greater than d we will eliminate everything left of &#39;d&#39; including &#39;d&#39; (chopping it in half) . [e f g h] is what now remains . again we would &#39;chop in half&#39; | say we iterate through &#39;g&#39; and &#39;h&#39;, our desired element is still not found so we would eliminate &#39;g; and &#39;h&#39; and continue the process | . [e f] . now we are down to 2 elements | &#39;chopping in half&#39; will give us our desired element | . [f] . | . def BinarySearch(array, x, low, high): # Repeat until the pointers low and high meet each other while low &lt;= high: mid = low + (high - low)//2 # find the middle (taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two) if array[mid] == x: # if desired number is the middle is found return desired number (middle number) return mid elif array[mid] &lt; x: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 return -1 array = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] x = 4 result = BinarySearch(array, x, 0, len(array)-1) if result != -1: print(&quot;Element is present at index &quot; + str(result)) else: print(&quot;Not found&quot;) . Element is present at index 1 . We have created a function called binary_search() function which takes two arguments - a list to be sorted and a number to be searched. . | We have declared two variables to store the lowest and highest values in the list. The lowest is assigned initial value to 0, the highest to len(list1) 1 and mid as 0. . | Next, we have declared the while loop with the condition that the lowest is equal and smaller than the highest. The while loop will iterate if the number has not been found yet. . | In the while loop, we find the mid value and compare the index value to the number we are searching for. . | If the value of the mid-index is smaller than n, we increase the mid value by 1 and assign it to the low. The search moves to the left side. . | Otherwise, if the value of mid index is larger than n, we decrease the mid value by 1 and assign it to the high. The search moves to the right side. . | If the n is equal to the mid value then return mid. . | This will happen until the low is equal and smaller than the high. . | If we reach at the end of the function, then the element is not present in the list. We return -1 to the calling function. . | . . Hacks . Using my example above and steps below, create your own iteration using binary search . Steps . Compare x with the middle element. | If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index. | Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half. | Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half. | . import random x = random.seed(10,20) print(x) . None . Homework Assignment (DUE FRIDAY 12/09 BY 5:00 PM) . Consider this situation: .

Coding all of these individually takes a lot of unnecessary time, how can we shorten this time? . Iteration . Iteration: repetition of a process applied to the result or taken from a previous statement. | Many types of iteration | Some are for loops, while loops, and &quot;for loop and range()&quot;, etc. | . Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are iterable . | Able to iterate with the iter() command. . There are 2 types of iteration:definite and indefinite. Definite iteration clarifies how many times the loop is going to run, while indefinite specifies a condition that must be met . | . for variable in iterable: statement() . Iterator? Iterable? Iteration? . When an object is iterable it can be used in an iteration | When passed through the function iter() it returns an iterator | Strings, lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples are all examples of iterable objects. | . a = [&#39;alpha&#39;, &#39;bravo&#39;, &#39;charlie&#39;] itr = iter(a) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) . alpha bravo charlie .

It is usually formatted in the way below because a 2D array is meant to be 2-dimensional: . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Printing a 2D Array . We already know that we can&#39;t just print the matrix by calling it. We need to iterate through it to print it. . def print_matrix1(matrix): for i in range(len(matrix)): # outer for loop. This runs on i which represents the row. range(len(matrix)) is in order to iterate through the length of the matrix for j in range(len(matrix[i])): # inner for loop. This runs on the length of the i&#39;th row in the matrix (j changes for each row with a different length) print(matrix[i][j], end=&quot; &quot;) # [i][j] is the 2D location of that value in the matrix, kinda like a coordinate pair. [i] iterates to the specific row and [j] iterates to the specific value in the row. end=&quot; &quot; changes the end value to space, not a new line. print() # prints extra line. this is in the outer loop, not the inner loop, because it only wants to print a new line for each row . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] print(&quot;Raw matrix (list of lists): &quot;) print(keypad) print(&quot;Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration:&quot;) print_matrix1(keypad) print() . Raw matrix (list of lists): [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&#39; &#39;, 0, &#39; &#39;]] Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] def print_matrix2(matrix): for row in matrix: # Iterates through each &quot;row&quot; of matrix. Row is a dummy variable, it could technically be anything. It iterates through each value of matrix and each value is it&#39;s own list. in this syntax the list is stored in &quot;row&quot;. for col in row: # Iterates through each value in row. Again col, column, is a dummy variable. Each value in row is stored in col. print(col, end=&quot; &quot;) # Same as 1 print() # Same as 1 print_matrix2(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . More Functions . Try to find another way to print the matrix. Only complete one of the two (unless you&#39;d like to do both). Below is a hint . fruit = [&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;bananas&quot;, &quot;grapes&quot;] print(fruit) print(*fruit) # Python built in function: &quot;*&quot;. Figure out what it does . [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;bananas&#39;, &#39;grapes&#39;] apples bananas grapes . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] def print_matrix3(matrix): for i in matrix: print(*i) print_matrix3(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . Alternatively, find a way to print the matrix using the iter() function you already learned. Or use both! . def print_matrix4(matrix): code = &quot;your code goes here&quot; . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] . Print what month you were born and how old you are by iterating through the keyboard (don&#39;t just write a string). . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] def printMonthAge(matrix): j=0 q = matrix[0] w = matrix[1] e = matrix[2] r = matrix[3] t = e[6] + w[6] + r[5] + w[2] y = str(q[1]) + str(q[5]) while j==0: print(&quot;Month born: &quot;, t) print(&quot;Age: &quot;, y) j += 1 printMonthAge(keyboard) . Month born: JUNE Age: 15 . Challenge . Change all of the letters that you DIDN&#39;T print above to spaces, &quot; &quot;, and then print the full keyboard. (the things you did print should remain in the same spot) . Alternative Challenge: If you would prefer, animate it using some form of delay so it flashes one of your letters at a time on the board in order and repeats.

Important to keep track of variables | Every time a new value is assigned to a variable it overrides the old value | . Hacks/Homework . Evaluate the variable &quot;result&quot;. . Num1 = 50 Num2 = Num1 % 9 + 15 Num3 = Num2 / Num1 + ( Num2 * 2 ) Num4 = Num3 + Num1 / 5 - 10 Result = Num4 - Num2 # Result should be 20.4 . Num1 = 10 Num2 = Num1 % 3 * 4 Num1 = Num2 Num3 = Num1 * 3 Result = Num3 % 2 # Result should be 0 . valueA = 4 valueB = 90 valueC = 17 valueB = valueC - valueA valueA = valueA * 10 if valueB &gt; 10: print(valueC) # valueB is 86 so it should print valueC which is 17 . type = &quot;curly&quot; color = &quot;brown&quot; length = &quot;short&quot; type = &quot;straight&quot; hair = type + color + length print(hair) # hair is straightbrownshort . Strings . String: a collection of characters(numbers, letters, spaces, special symbols, etc.) . Ways to use strings: . len(): find the length of a string . lower(): convert to lowercase . Pseudocode: . len(): returns the length of a string . concat(): returns a string made up of the concatenated strings ex. concat(&quot;string1&quot;, &quot;string2&quot;) would return string1string2 . substring(): returns the characters from the string beginning at the at the first position to the last so an example of this would be substring (&quot;abcdefghijk&quot;, 2, 5) would print bcde (pseudocode starts at 1) . Hacks . Find the result of the following problems. Then convert the pseudocode to working python code using your knowledge of python string operators. . Problem 1 . Noun = &quot;Mr.Mortenson&quot; Adjective = &quot;handsome&quot; Adjective2 = &quot;Very&quot; Verb = &quot;is&quot; abrev = Noun[0:7] yoda = Adjective2+ &quot; &quot;+ Adjective+ &quot; &quot;+ abrev+ &quot; &quot;+Verb+ &quot;.&quot; print(yoda) . Very handsome Mr.Mort is. . Problem 2 . cookie = &quot;choclate&quot; cookie2 = &quot;raisin&quot; len1 = len(cookie) / 2 len2 = len(cookie2) * 45 vote1 = cookie + &quot; vote &quot; + str(len2) vote2 = cookie2 + &quot; vote &quot; + str(len1) votes = vote1+ &quot; &quot; + vote2 print(votes) . choclate vote 270 raisin vote 4.0 .",

It was a tutorial on how to progress through the battle pass. I do play Fortnite, so this video is very relevant to me. . My Project and Ideas . Next time, we could arrive a bit more earlier so then the room won’t be very crowded. This means that we can have more freedom on where to present, making the process of presenting much more smooth. | Some ideas of better time management could be to go to different classrooms and take notes on their things while waiting to present. This way, it can make the process much more efficient, and I can also save time and go home earlier. | My project involved a scheduler using a calendar. You can press on any day of the month, type in an event, then save the event. The saved event appears on the scheduler window and shows the date of the event.

Invention is start a new thing, innovation makes the new thing more useful. | There are always people who will be smarter, more athletic, etc. than you. However, you can lead from any position. | Don’t think that you are incapable of running a leadership position. | Keep the end result in mind | Don’t blindly follow something, be curious and question what you do | You can learn more stuff from going to a teacher’s classroom in office hours | Building skills with technical feats along with making friends is a way to success | Stanford’s computer science program helps build skills for success | When you get an opportunity, take it and do something about it, don’t dismiss it | Your value is your perspective, not just how much you know about coding | Your perspective provides the most value for the team | Interview should be more of a conversation | You will fail more than you succeed, the more you fail, the more you will learn which is better than succeeding all the time | . Paragraph . I learned that I should become more future-focused and don’t be afraid to try new things. I should focus more on the end goal, and think about what I can achieve with it. I should keep persisting and not be afraid to fail, since failing only makes me wiser and increases my chance of success. In the presentation, one of the tenants mentioned how it’s important to take opportunities. The speaker was afraid of taking a leadership position, but she was encouraged to, and ended up becoming successful. Therefore, I should also take advantage of opportunities later on when they come. Computer science is also not just all about coding, it’s more about my perspective in the team. So, while I should be learning more about coding, I should also be aware of my opinions and what I feel is good for the team. Stanford’s computer science program is especially good at helping to develop important life skills for the future. I learned also to think more critically about my actions and future, so then I can be aware of what I am doing and not blindly follow a path. .",

An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. Here are some samples, these are not qualified in any way. . RapidAPI- GitHub Project | No Key APIs Article | Twitter Developer | Google Developer | Reddit Developer | . Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). However, for this Hack you can pick your preference. We will discuss pros and cons in next API tech talk. .",

Our plan is to create a managing and planning system using data from Canvas. We will try to use Canvas’s API(It is public and we are allowed to use it) to recieve information on peoples’ assignments, events, etc. Our purpose of creating this is to help make students’ planners easy to make, as well as helping them to be more organized while also saving time by using an automated system to help do the planning for them. . Row 1: Program Purpose and Function . Our program’s purpose is to provide an automated organizer for students’ tasks. The function is to utilize a calendar and allow students to add, remove, and edit events on each day. Students will also be able to sign in with their own account in order to save their events. . Row 2: Data Abstraction . The data will be a list which includes a students’ events. As a student adds, removes, or edits an event, the list will change. The name of the variable representing the list will be calendarEvent, or some variable related to events on a calendar. . Row 3: Managing Complexity . We can manage the complexity by creating a new list specific to each user. Then, we can create a list of all the users, making the entire project easy to manage. . Row 4: Procedural Abstraction . My student-developed procedure is to make the login screen for the website. I will also help to log all of the information entered by the users when they first use the scheduler. . Row 5: Algorithm Implementation . While we have not started on the project yet, our plan is to make a list inside of a list, etc. The list can be appended by using a while loop. . Row 6: Testing . After making slight changes, I will test the code by using a local server. I will do it very often in order to make sure that everything is working before I move onto a new task. .",

            "content": "Blog Reflections . Me and my partner, Noor, have decided on making a math quiz on applab for the week 4 requirement. We plan on using basic math questions to test out applabs developer tool. We will use the given code blocks and experiment around to find the proper layout for the quiz we want. We plan on them that they are guaranteed a 0% on their next math test. It is what it is. We will also add a rickroll at the end of the quiz. Some struggles that we faced were how to record the score for the quiz. It took us a while, but we managed to add the score to the quiz. I also originally wanted to add an error screen when you got a question wrong, but it did not work out very well, so we just added a sound effect instead. One way that I worked with data is to store a variable for the score of the quiz. The base score is 3, and each incorrect selection subtracts a point. The quiz code was also placed in chronological order, going from clicking functions for the title screen to the end of the quiz. This is because java runs from top to bottom, so coding from the bottom to the top would possibly lead to errors. . It was challenging to put all those semicolons at the end of every line. The commands were also slightly different from python, preventing the code from being very straightforward. . Some ideas for the college board create task is to make an AI quiz, which can start to learn your own learning preferences. . .",

            "content": "Insights and Takeaways from the Panel . I learned that computer science is perfect for those who like problem solving. I am personally okay with it, so I’m pretty sure computer science is good for me. I also learned that having logical thinking is crucial for engineering majors, and this is especially true when you have to code in these majors, since coding requires step-by-step logic. Computer science is very important to use in real world situations, since it is used everywhere as the world relies more on the internet. Therefore, if one wants to make an impact, then they should learn computer science well. When it comes to learning CSP at DNHS, I learned that I should use Google more often when researching for the correct syntax. This way, it is much more efficient, and I don’t have to be asking others online and waiting forever for a reponse. It’s also best not to cut corners and not just do things for points. By doing things just for a grade, it takes away the purpose of learning, which isn’t really good in the long run. I also shouldn’t give up when running into problems with the code. While I do think that I have done a pretty good job in this area, I believe that I can still improve by changing my mindset so I don’t always get so frustrated when running into a problem. One of the biggest challenges is getting started with computer science, which I believe a lot after going through the first few weeks of school. However, I believe that I should keep pushing and not give up. The takeaway that I believe is the most important is to not compare yourselves to others. Del Norte is a very competitive school, therefore, there’s a lot of pressure to keep up with other people. But, by doing so, it only wastes your time from doing things that you are passionate about, and puts a lot of unnecessary stress on yourself. As a result, the main takeaway is that I should focus on what I like to do, and once I do it well, then I will be able to stand out from others in a unique way. .",

Managing Complexity | 1 | 0 | The list was shown to manage complexity by making the code more efficient. The result of not using the list is also clearly explained. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | A procedure is shown in the first code segment but it is missing parameters. A different function is called in the second code segment. | .

Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 1 | The procedure is shown and is called, but the parameters are very weird and I’m not sure if that’s the proper way to use parameters. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | For loops and if statements are used, demonstrating sequencing, selection, and iteration. The described steps are also detailed enough to be able to know every part of the procedure. | . Testing | 1 | 0 | The two calls use different arguments and use the procedure in 3c. The conditions and results are explained in adequate detail. | . Reflection: . As a final summary, by combining all the CPT scorings I’ve done, the most important lesson would be that I do not have to be extremely detailed when answering some questions. This is because I am a very detail-oriented person, and I always try to make things as detailed as possible. However, based on the CPT scorings, I’ve noticed patterns where you do not have to be extremely detailed(such as in identifying the purpose or list as well as describing the functionality). But, there are some parts where great detail is necessary, such as when explaining the steps of an algorithm and describing the identified procedure. Based on the scorings for just the CPT scoring part 3, I’ve noticed that lists and procedures can have data stored in it and have it called in many creative ways. For example, submission 1 did not just outright show a list being created. Instead, it had data stored inside of a procedure, which demonstrates creativity and innovation. I also learned that the testing should refer specifically to the code and not just on what the user sees when using the program. In addition, the arguments should have specific values and the conditions should be related to the parameter or arguments. If no value is given to the parameters, it is likely that a person will be stating the functionality of the code rather than an actual tested value. .",

I was only looking for key words in their descriptions. This means that I should be more detailed next time to find any problems with the submission’s descriptions. Overall, I think that my program should be very detailed in order to ensure that I get the maximum possible points. The submissions that got low scores had very vague descriptions, while the submissions that got high scores had very detailed descriptions. For the last submission, the testing part failed to meet the standard because it tested for one thing and gave two possible outputs. However, these are outputs and are not two different calls to the function. .",

For Submission 1, Collegeboard did not give the point for Program Pupose and Function because the purpose was not valid. However, I did award a point thinking that the purpose was good enough. This means that when I submit my project to Collegeboard, I should go deeper in the purpose and not just specify the overall function of the program(While also keeping it concise to about 1 sentence). For Submission 2, I did not give a point for Data Abstraction because I thought that you needed to take a screenshot of the variable of the list for the code segment. However, Collegeboard did give the point for Data Abstraction because the code segments did show the use of the lists. While the list wasn’t directly stated in the code segment, the code segment still shows the utilization of the lists which makes this category valid for a point. Also, the names of the lists were specified in 3.b.iii so the grader knows which variables are lists in the code. Therefore, a point for Data Abstraction was awarded. This tells to me that I should show the utilization of a list in the code segments rather than just showing the creation of the variable of the list. Overall, through grading these submissions, I realized that for much of 3a I do not have to write up a whole paragraph for each subsection. I am now aware that I should be more detailed in the code segments and on explaining the code when I will be making my project. .",
