            "content": "Blog Reflections . Me and my partner, Noor, have decided on making a math quiz on applab for the week 4 requirement. We plan on using basic math questions to test out applabs developer tool. We will use the given code blocks and experiment around to find the proper layout for the quiz we want. We plan on them that they are guaranteed a 0% on their next math test. It is what it is. We will also add a rickroll at the end of the quiz. Some struggles that we faced were how to record the score for the quiz. It took us a while, but we managed to add the score to the quiz. I also originally wanted to add an error screen when you got a question wrong, but it did not work out very well, so we just added a sound effect instead. One way that I worked with data is to store a variable for the score of the quiz. The base score is 3, and each incorrect selection subtracts a point. The quiz code was also placed in chronological order, going from clicking functions for the title screen to the end of the quiz. This is because java runs from top to bottom, so coding from the bottom to the top would possibly lead to errors. . It was challenging to put all those semicolons at the end of every line. The commands were also slightly different from python, preventing the code from being very straightforward. . Some ideas for the college board create task is to make an AI quiz, which can start to learn your own learning preferences. . .",

            "content": "Insights and Takeaways from the Panel . I learned that computer science is perfect for those who like problem solving. I am personally okay with it, so I’m pretty sure computer science is good for me. I also learned that having logical thinking is crucial for engineering majors, and this is especially true when you have to code in these majors, since coding requires step-by-step logic. Computer science is very important to use in real world situations, since it is used everywhere as the world relies more on the internet. Therefore, if one wants to make an impact, then they should learn computer science well. When it comes to learning CSP at DNHS, I learned that I should use Google more often when researching for the correct syntax. This way, it is much more efficient, and I don’t have to be asking others online and waiting forever for a reponse. It’s also best not to cut corners and not just do things for points. By doing things just for a grade, it takes away the purpose of learning, which isn’t really good in the long run. I also shouldn’t give up when running into problems with the code. While I do think that I have done a pretty good job in this area, I believe that I can still improve by changing my mindset so I don’t always get so frustrated when running into a problem. One of the biggest challenges is getting started with computer science, which I believe a lot after going through the first few weeks of school. However, I believe that I should keep pushing and not give up. The takeaway that I believe is the most important is to not compare yourselves to others. Del Norte is a very competitive school, therefore, there’s a lot of pressure to keep up with other people. But, by doing so, it only wastes your time from doing things that you are passionate about, and puts a lot of unnecessary stress on yourself. As a result, the main takeaway is that I should focus on what I like to do, and once I do it well, then I will be able to stand out from others in a unique way. .",
