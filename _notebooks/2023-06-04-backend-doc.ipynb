    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our backend was based on a Flask server with a SQLAlchemy database storing the user's data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Flask?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Flask is a web framework that allows developers to build web applications using Python. It is lightweight, flexible, and easy to use, making it popular for creating small to medium-sized web applications or APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Flask follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, but it's known for its simplicity and minimalistic approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask provides the basic tools and features needed to develop web applications, but it doesn't impose a specific structure or design pattern. This flexibility allows developers to choose how they organize their code and design their application. Flask's core philosophy is to keep things simple and allow developers to add additional functionality as needed through third-party extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Flask, developers can define routes to handle different URLs and HTTP methods, allowing developers to define the behavior of their application. It also includes a template engine, Jinja2, which enables developers to create dynamic HTML pages. Flask supports various extensions for database integration, form handling, user authentication, and more, making it highly customizable and adaptable to different project requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Flask is a popular choice for Python web development due to its simplicity, flexibility, and large community support. It allows developers to quickly build web applications with minimal overhead and provides a solid foundation for expanding functionality as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is SQLAlchemy?\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLAlchemy is a powerful and popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. It provides a high-level, intuitive interface for interacting with relational databases, making it easier to work with database records using Python objects and queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of SQLAlchemy is to bridge the gap between the object-oriented world of Python and the relational world of databases. It allows developers to define database models as Python classes, where each class represents a table in the database and its attributes represent the columns. SQLAlchemy then handles the translation of these Python objects into SQL statements, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, to interact with the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, SQLAlchemy is widely used in Python web development and other database-driven applications. It provides a robust and efficient way to interact with databases using Python, abstracting away much of the complexities of database management and allowing developers to focus on their application logic."
