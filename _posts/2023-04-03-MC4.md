# MC #4 Test Corrections
## Score: 42/50

# Question 8

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot (271).png)

A is correct, C is incorrect. C is wrong because access to public data is individual, not using a network. D is right because it involves networking with frequently visited servers.

# Question 9

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot (272).png)

Data is sent by breaking files in packets. There is no direct connection.

# Question 11

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot (273).png)

Sorted lists combined might not result in a fully sorted data. Combine both first and then sort so data can be completely sorted.

# Question 27

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot (274).png)

Creating negative of image is lossless, so C is right. A is wrong because that would be lossy compression.

# Question 36

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot (275).png)

Must find the one that doesn't run in a reasonable amount of time. Factorial doesn't run in a reasonable amount of time so heuristic works best for it.

# Question 37

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot (276).png)

Polynomial algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time. So, B is correct.

# Question 44

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot (277).png)

C is correct because student doesn't know how to do it. Code is not duplicated because of procedural abstraction.

# Question 47

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot (278).png)

Data is cut in half a max of 15. Think of this like half-life of a chemical reaction or radioactive decay.
