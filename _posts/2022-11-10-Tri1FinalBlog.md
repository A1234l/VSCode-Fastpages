# My Mistakes

16: Messages are broken into packets, but they can be reassembled regardless of the order they are recieved in.

17: Routing on the internet is not specified in advance. Open protocols standardize data transmission. Think about email sending protocol and text messaging protocol.

19: There will be an overflow error. 16+4+2+1 is less than 29.

20: Four bits is 2^4 which is 16. 16 things of information are enough for storing 8 things.

24: Binary 1011 is 11, it should be before decimal 12

36: It is consecutive even integers, not consecutive integers. append before adding i to do consecutive even integers.

37: You need a temporary variable to interchange values.
