# Notes

DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): Connect to your WiFi
- We're typing in URL for the frontend. When we do this, we're activating our browser.
- The first thing that happens when you type in a URL is 
- domain refers to IP address
- When you type in your browser with your domain name, it's gonna do a DNS lookup. That's gonna give you an IP address and then github.io server
- When you have a button on frontend, you're doing a backend request
    - Fetch has a URL and is gonna talk to another server
    - When we do fetch in backend it's gonna return JSON
