# Hacks

Observations from changing the theme:
I noticed that the features from the pages folder are not on the fastpage. The links are also glowing. Transitioning between the blog posts are a lot harder and less fluid because the "Alan's Fastpages" link does not work. The favicon on the tab also does not work.
