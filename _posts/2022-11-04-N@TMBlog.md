# APCSP Projects

## Yuri and Harsha's coding group:
Their project involved a timer website. There was an alarm, stopwatch, and timer. The theme is a white background with black text. The website domain is very impressive, with a .com at the end. (Keep blogging at home)

## Emaad's coding group:
Emaad created a similar website to my group. His website involves a calendar which is used to schedule things(Ask for website from Emaad).

# 3D Animation Artworks

## Inside a House Looking Through the Glass at the Mountains
This 3D animation artwork was very interesting. In the viewer's perspective, they are looking out a huge window. The table has a donut and a coffee. There is a crack in the glass, and the snow-capped mountains are visible outside.

## Donuts
Many artworks had donuts in their piece. A majority involved a room with a table with a donut on a plate.

# Video presentations

## About My Life Videos
I noticed that most of the videos involved a presentation about their life. The title image was also mostly the same. The intros were very inspirational as well.

## Fortnite Battle Pass Tutorial
I noticed a very interesting video project that involved Fortnite. It was a tutorial on how to progress through the battle pass. I do play Fortnite, so this video is very relevant to me.
