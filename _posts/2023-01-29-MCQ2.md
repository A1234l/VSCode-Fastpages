I got this wrong because by the last step "sheep" would already have the "goats" value in it, so "goats" would still remain as "goats."

Input A must be "true" because if A was false, then two of the same values in a OR operator would return false, which would make the output after the AND operator as false.

The algorithm is choosing which numbers are even. This requires selection.

Both algorithms work because algorithm A adds all the students' values and discards the previously added value. The end value would result in the sum of all the students' heights, so algorithm A works.

Algorithm I doesn't work for values less than -1. If all values are less than -1, then the max would be -1. However, this is not the case as no values are -1.

Finding shortest driving route is an optimization problem that can't be solved in a reasonable time, so a heurisitc is needed. B doesn't require a heuristic because encryption uses math formulas to process file in a reasonable time.
