# 2018 MC Test Corrections
# Score: 62/66

## Corrections:

### Question 9
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/20189.png)

I got this question wrong because it seems like I don't fully understand iterative processes. Low-level abstractions are unrelated to iterative and incremental process.

### Question 12
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/201812.png)

The question is asking for the estimate in year 12. That means I would have to increase the data by about 1-1.2 instead of 0.6 since that would mean the number at year 11.

### Question 47
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/201847.png)

The sender's private key does not decrypt a message. You are sending it yourself so you don't need decryption. Only the recipient needs to decrypt the message and that is made possible through the recipient's private key.

### Question 54
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/201854.png)

The question is asking for a generalized procedure, not a specific one. Fourth(n) is not generalized. The generalization for the two given procedures involve powers, so it makes sense that the generalized procedure in this one is Power(n,m).
