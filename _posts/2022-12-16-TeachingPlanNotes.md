# College Board Notes Undecidable Problems
- Decidable problems: Yes/no answer for any given input. Output is always correct.
- Undecidable problem: No algorithm can be made which is always able to have a correct output of yes/no
    - Halting problem: Given an arbitrary computer program with given inputs, will the program stop of will it run forever?
    - No way to solve with yes/no answer all the time
    - Ex of Halting Problem: Website take too logn to load. Computer stops programs after certain amount of time

# Youtube Video Notes([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92WHN-pAFCs))
- Machine to diagnose whether a code runs forever or not is logically impossible
- If combined into one huge machine, a negator can reverse the output of machine which diagnoses a halt
    - Since negator contradicts that machine, it shows that the entire computer is not correct, so it's not always accurate. This is an undecidable problem shown by the Halting Problem.

# Khan Academy Notes([Link](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/algorithms-101/solving-hard-problems/a/undecidable-problems))

- Khan Academy explains the same thing as the Youtube Video. The flow chart is very good, could possibly be used for teaching.
- Computers cannot tell if a program runs forever, if loop takes too long, the code terminates

# Lesson Plan for Unit 3.18(My part)
- Use Khan Academy flow chart or make one similar to it.
- Expect people to get very confused at first. Try your best to explaining things better and teach it one step at a time
- To teach it one step at a time, first demonstrate a forever running code. You can do this through an integer test but you add 1 everytime, so computer runs forever
- For decidable problem, just do a simple math program. Almost anything works for undecidable problem
- For hacks, try doing something related to undecidable problems that doesn't involve any code, since it's too complex to use much code.
