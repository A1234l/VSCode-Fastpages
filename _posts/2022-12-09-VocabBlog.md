# Vocab Unit 2
Bits: A place value in powers of 2. 1 = true, the place value is added. 
- `Ex: 0 = false, the place value isn't added.`

Bytes: 8 bits.
- `Ex: 10110100`

Hexadecimal: a series of 6 digits representing color. It is base 16. It goes from 0-9 and then a-f.
- `Ex: RGB, #000000, #000001, etc.`

Nibbles: 4 bits.
- `Ex: 1011`



# Vocab Unit 3
Variables: A type of data assigned to an arbitrary value.
- `variable = 1`
Data types: Four data types: integers(ex: 10), boolean(ex: true/false), string(ex: "hi"), and list(ex: ["hi", "hello"])

Assignment operators: things that assign values in relation to another value.
- Ex: `+=, -=`

Lists: A data type that is able to store multiple values which can be extracted.
- `list = ["hi", "hello"]`

2D Lists: A list inside a list.
- `list = [`
- `    [1,2,3],`
- `    [4,5,6]`
- `    ]`

Dictionaries: Stores data in key:value pairs.
- `dictionary = {`
- `    "number1" : 10`
- `    "number2" : 20`
- `}`

Class: A blueprint for creating something.
- `class word:`
- `   print("hi")`
- `   Print("hello")`

Algorithm: Set of instructions to do a task.
Ex: flowcharts demonstrate an algorithm.

Sequence: A series of tasks in the order of specification
- `x = 10`
- `y = 20`
- `z = 30`
- `z = x+y`
- `x = z`

Selection: Uses true/false to determine which code is executed.

- `if x==0:`
- `    print(x)`
- `else:`

Iteration: Repeats a code if condition is true.
- `while x == true:`
- `    print(true)`
