# Summary

What I learned in this event is that computer science is very helpful in almost all STEM fields, and that I will probably need to use computer science at some point if I plan to do a STEM major. This event was also really helpful to me as I have been recently searching for research programs for chemistry and biology. I will definitely consider participating in the programs that CSUSM has. It's also really given me insight on college life, scholarships, and what I should have in order to do very well in college.
