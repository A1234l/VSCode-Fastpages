# Collaboration Blog

My group is not set up strictly on the basis of current friends. Some people in my table are people I have not known in the past before taking CSP. My group setup is sort of diverse since we have sophomores and juniors. My group is well equipped with the skill sets needed for success. We are all very motivated to learn CSP, and some of us are also already experienced with coding.
