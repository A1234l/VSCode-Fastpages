This project is a fitness website. The purpose is to solve the problem of an unhealthy lifestyle. The age, weight, height, and gender can be inputed and the output is the BMI. There will also be the max calories, what sport is best, and the methods of working out. Lists are used in the system that adds food, and there is a procedure for calculating calories.

I went to the ceramics room and saw lots of beautiful pottery. They looked very complex and had all kinds of different shapes and sizes. The octopus one was the coolest because it must've been hard to make all those tentacles.

# Computer Animation:

I went into the computer animation room and I saw many different cool things. Many of them were animated rooms and a lot of them also had donuts.

# 3D Animation:

The donuts in 3D animation were really cool and I liked how they played with the lighting. The donuts were also very colorful.

# Photography:

The photos depicted many different things in many different styles. They looked very professional, and I wonder how they managed to take pictures of some of the things.
