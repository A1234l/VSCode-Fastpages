- Keep the end result in mind
- Don't blindly follow something, be curious and question what you do
- You can learn more stuff from going to a teacher's classroom in office hours
- Building skills with technical feats along with making friends is a way to success
- Stanford's computer science program helps build skills for success
- When you get an opportunity, take it and do something about it, don't dismiss it
- Your value is your perspective, not just how much you know about coding
- Your perspective provides the most value for the team
- Interview should be more of a conversation
- You will fail more than you succeed, the more you fail, the more you will learn which is better than succeeding all the time

# Paragraph

I learned that I should become more future-focused and don't be afraid to try new things. I should focus more on the end goal, and think about what I can achieve with it. I should keep persisting and not be afraid to fail, since failing only makes me wiser and increases my chance of success. In the presentation, one of the tenants mentioned how it's important to take opportunities. The speaker was afraid of taking a leadership position, but she was encouraged to, and ended up becoming successful. Therefore, I should also take advantage of opportunities later on when they come. Computer science is also not just all about coding, it's more about my perspective in the team. So, while I should be learning more about coding, I should also be aware of my opinions and what I feel is good for the team. Stanford's computer science program is especially good at helping to develop important life skills for the future. I learned also to think more critically about my actions and future, so then I can be aware of what I am doing and not blindly follow a path.
