# Project Plan

Our plan is to create a managing and planning system using data from Canvas. We will try to use Canvas's API(It is public and we are allowed to use it) to recieve information on peoples' assignments, events, etc. Our purpose of creating this is to help make students' planners easy to make, as well as helping them to be more organized while also saving time by using an automated system to help do the planning for them.
